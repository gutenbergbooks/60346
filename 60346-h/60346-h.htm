  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There was once a gardener. Not only was, but
in all probability is, for as far as I know you may
meet him to this day. There are no death-bed
scenes in this book. The gardener was not the sort
of person to bring a novel to a graceful climax by
dying finally in an atmosphere of elevated immorality.
He was extremely thin, but not in the least
unhealthy. He never with his own consent ran any
risk of sudden death. Nobody would ever try to
introduce him into a real book, for he was in no way
suitable. He was not a philosopher. Not an adventurer.
Not a gay dog. Not lively: but he lived,
and that at least is a great merit.</p>

<p class='c009'>In appearance the gardener was a fairly mediocre
study in black and white. He had a white and
wooden face, black hair as smooth as a wet seal’s
back, thin arms and legs, and enormous hands and
feet. He was not indispensable to any one, but he
believed that he was a pillar supporting the world.
It sometimes makes one nervous to reflect what very
amateur pillars the world seems to employ.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>He lived in a boarding-house in Penny Street, W.
A boarding-house is a place full of talk, it has as
many eyes as a peacock, and ears to correspond. It
is lamentably little, and yet impossible to ignore.
It is not a dignified foundation for a pillar.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener was twenty-three. Twenty-three is
said to be the prime of life by those who have reached
so far and no farther. It shares this distinction with
every age, from ten to three-score and ten.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the first of June, in his twenty-fourth year, the
gardener broke his boot-lace. The remains of the
catastrophe dangled from his hand. String was out
of the question; one cannot be decent dressed in
string, he thought, with that touch of exaggeration
common to victims of disasters. The world was a
sordid and sardonic master, there was no heart in
the breast of Fate. He was bereft even of his dignity,
there is no dignity in the death of a boot-lace.
The gardener’s twenty-three years were stripped
from him like a cloak. He felt little and naked.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was so busy with his emotions that he had
forgotten that the door of his room was open.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was rather like the girl Courtesy to stand on
the landing boldly staring in at a man sitting on his
bedroom floor crushed by circumstances. She had
no idea of what was fitting. Any other woman
would have recognised the presence of despair, and
would have passed by with head averted.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the girl Courtesy said, “Poor lamb, has it
broken its boot-lace?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>The gardener continued in silence to watch the
strangling of his vanity by the corpse of the boot-lace.
His chief characteristic was a whole heart in
all that he did.</p>

<p class='c009'>A tear should have appeared in Courtesy’s eye at
the sight of him. But it did not.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give me the boot,” she said, advancing into the
room in the most unwomanly manner. And she
knotted the boot-lace with a cleverness so unexpected—considering
the sort of girl she was—that the
difference in its length was negligible, and the knot
was hidden beneath the other lace.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Women have their uses,” thought the gardener.
But the thought was short-lived, for Courtesy’s next
remark was:</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, boy, run along and keep smilin’. Somebody
loves you.” And she patted him on the cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now it has been made clear that the gardener was
a Man of Twenty-three. He turned his back violently
on the woman, put on his boot, and walked
downstairs bristling with dignity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl Courtesy not only failed to be cut to the
heart by the silent rebuke, but she failed to realise
that she had offended. She was rather fat, and
rather obtuse. She was half an inch taller than the
gardener, and half a dozen years older.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener’s indignation rode him downstairs.
It spurred him to force his hat down on his head at
a most unbecoming angle, it supplied the impetus for
a passionate slamming of the door. But on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>door-step it evaporated suddenly. It was replaced
by a rosy and arresting thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor soul, she loves me,” said the gardener.
He adjusted his hat, and stepped out into London,
a breaker of hearts, a Don Juan, unconscious of his
charm yet conscious of his unconsciousness. “Poor
thing, poor thing,” he thought, and remembered
with regret that Courtesy had not lost her appetite.
On the contrary, she had been looking even plumper
of late. But then Courtesy never quite played the
game.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I begin to be appreciated,” reflected the gardener.
“I always knew the world would find out
some day....”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener was a dreamer of dreams, and a
weaver of many theories. His theories were not
even tangible enough to make a philosophy, yet
against them he measured his world. And any
shortcomings he placed to the world’s account. He
wrapped himself in theories to such an extent that
facts were crowded from his view, he posed until
he lost himself in a wilderness of poses. He was
not the victim of consistency, that most ambiguous
virtue. The dense and godly wear consistency as
a flower, the imaginative fling it joyfully behind them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Imagination seems to be a glory and a misery, a
blessing and a curse. Adam, to his sorrow, lacked
it. Eve, to her sorrow, possessed it. Had both
been blessed—or cursed—with it, there would
have been much keener competition for the apple.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>The million eyes of female London pricked the
gardener, or so he imagined, as he threaded the
Strand. He felt as if a glance from his eye was a
blessing, and he bestowed it generously. The full
blaze of it fell upon one particular girl as she walked
towards him. She seemed to the gardener to be
almost worthy. Her yellow hair suffered from
Marcelle spasms at careful intervals of an inch and
a half, every possible tooth enjoyed publicity. The
gardener recognised a kindred soul. A certain
shade of yellow hair always at this period thatched
a kindred soul for the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>He followed the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>He followed her even into the gaping jaws of an
underground station. There she bought cigarettes
at a tobacco stall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She smokes,” thought the gardener. “This is
life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He went close to her while she paid. She was
not in the least miserly of a certain cheap smell of
violets. The gardener was undaunted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shall we take a taxi, Miss?” he suggested, his
wide eager smile a trifle damped by self-consciousness.
For this was his first attempt of the kind.
“They say Kew is lovely just now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was his theory that spoke. In practice he had
but threepence in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>She replied, “Bless you, kid. Run ’ome to
mammy, do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her voice sounded like the scent she wore. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>had a hard tone which somehow brought the solitary
threepence to mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener returned at great speed to Penny
Street.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was lunch-time at Number Twenty-one. The
eternal hash approached its daily martyrdom.
Hash is a worthy thing, but it reminds you that you
are not at the Ritz. There is nothing worse calculated
to make you forget a lonely threepenny bit
in your pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener had a hundred a year. He was
apparently the only person in London with a hundred
a year, for wherever he went he always found
himself the wealthiest person present. His friends
gave his natural generosity a free rein. After various
experiments in social economy, he found it cheapest
to rid himself of the hundred a year immediately
on its quarterly appearance, and live on his expectations
for the rest of the time. There are drawbacks
about this plan, as well as many advantages. But
the gardener was a pillar, and he found it easier to
support the world than to support himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was on this occasion that his neighbour at
luncheon, unaware of his pillar-hood, asked him what
he was doing for a living.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Living,” replied the gardener. He was not absolutely
sure that it made sense, but it sounded epigrammatic.
He was, in some lights, a shameless
prig. But then one often is, if one thinks, at twenty-three.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“It’s all living,” he continued to his neighbour.
“It’s all life. Being out of a job is life. Being
kicked is life. Starving’s life. Dying’s life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The neighbour did not reply because he was busy
eating. One had to keep one’s attention fixed on
the food problem at 21 Penny Street. There was
no time for epigrams. It was a case of the survival
of the most silent. The gardener was very thin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl Courtesy, however, was one who could
do two things at once. She could support life and
impart information at the same time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do believe you talk for the sake of talking,”
she said; and it was true. “How can dying be living?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is most annoying to have the cold light of feminine
logic turned on to an impromptu epigram.
The gardener pushed the parsnips towards her as
a hint that she was talking too much. But Courtesy
had the sort of eye that sees no subtlety in parsnips.
Her understanding was of the black and white type.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Death is the door to life,” remarked Miss
Shakespeare, nailing down the golden opportunity
with eagerness. 21 Penny Street very rarely gave
Miss Shakespeare the satisfaction of such an opening.
There was, however, a lamentable lack of response.
The subject, which had been upheld contrary
to the laws of gravitation, fell heavily to
earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is this your threepenny bit or mine?” asked the
girl Courtesy. For that potent symbol, the victim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>of its owner’s absence of mind, in the course of violent
exercise between the gardener’s plate and hers,
had fallen into her lap.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whose idea was it to make money round? I
sometimes feel certain I could control it better if
it were square.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is mine,” said the gardener, still posing as a
philosopher. “A little splinter out of the brimstone
lake. Feel it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy smelt it without repulsion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Talk again,” she said. “Where would you be
without money?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where would I be without money? Where
would I be without any of the vices? Singing in
Paradise, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I pocket this threepenny bit,” said Courtesy,
that practical girl, “what will you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you—and good-bye,” replied the gardener.
“It is my last link with the world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy put it in her purse. “Good-bye,” she
said. “So sorry you must go. Reserve a halo for
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener rose immediately and walked upstairs
with decision into his bedroom, which, by some
freak of chance, was papered blue to match his soul.
It was indeed the anteroom of the gardener’s soul.
Nightly he went through it into the palace of himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>He took out of it now his toothbrush, a change
of raiment, and Hilda. It occurs to me that I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>not yet mentioned Hilda. She was a nasturtium in
a small pot.</p>

<p class='c009'>On his way downstairs he met Miss Shakespeare,
who held the destinies of 21 Penny Street, and did
not hold with the gardener’s unexpected ways.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your weekly account&nbsp;...” she began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have left everything I have as hostages with
fate,” said the gardener. “When I get tired of
Paradise I’ll come back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On the door-step he exclaimed, “I will be a merry
vagabond, tra-la-la&nbsp;...” and he stepped out transfigured—in
theory.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he passed the dining-room window he caught
sight of the red of Courtesy’s hair, as she characteristically
continued eating.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An episode,” he thought. “Unscathed I pass
on. And the woman, as women must, remains to
weep and grow old. Courtesy, my little auburn
lover, I have passed on—for ever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But he had to return two minutes later to fetch
a pocket-handkerchief from among the hostages.
And Courtesy, as she met him in the hall, nodded in
an unsuitably unscathed manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener walked, with Hilda in his hand. It
became night. Practically speaking, it is of course
impossible for night to occur within three paragraphs
of luncheon-time. But actually the day is often to
me as full of holes as a Gruyère cheese.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the gardener the beginnings of a walk which
he felt sure must eventually find a place in history
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>were torn ruthlessly out of his experience. He was
thinking about red hair, and all things red.</p>

<p class='c009'>He hoped that Hilda, when she flowered, would
be the exact shade of a certain head of hair he had
lately seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hoping and planning for Hilda like a mother-to-be,”
he thought, but that pose was impossible to sustain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not think of the girl Courtesy at all. Only
her hair flamed in his memory. The remembrance
of the rest of her was as faint and lifeless as a hairdresser’s
dummy.</p>

<p class='c009'>It struck him that auburn, with orange lights in the
sunlight, was the colour of heat, the colour of heaven,
the colour of life and love. He looked round at the
characteristic London female passer-by, the thin-breasted
girl, with hair the colour of wet sand, and
reflected that Woman is a much rarer creature than
she appears to be.</p>

<p class='c009'>He recovered consciousness in Kensington Gardens
at dusk. He remembered that he was a merry
vagabond.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tra-la-la&nbsp;...” he sang as he passed a park-keeper.</p>

<p class='c009'>People in authority seem as a rule to be shy of the
pose. The park-keeper was not exactly shy, but he
made a murmured protest against the Tra-la-la, and
saw the gardener to the gate with most offensive care.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>In theory the gardener spent the night at the Ritz.
In practice he slept on the Embankment. He was a
man of luck in little things, and the night was the first
fine night for several weeks. The gardener followed
the moon in its light fall across the sky. Several
little stars followed it too, in and out of the small
smiling clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moon threaded its way in and out of the
gardener’s small smiling dreams. Oh mad moon,
you porthole, looking up into a fantastic Paradise!</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener did not dream of red hair. That
subject was exhausted.</p>

<p class='c009'>When an undecided sun blinked through smoked
glasses at the Thames, and at the little steamers
sleeping with their funnels down like sea-gulls on the
water with their heads under their wings, the gardener
rose. He had a bath and a shave—in theory—and
walked southward. Tra-la-la.</p>

<p class='c009'>He walked very fast when he got beyond the tramways,
but after a while a woman who was walking
behind him caught him up. Women are apt to get
above themselves in these days, I think.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to walk with you,” said the woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?” asked the gardener, who spent some
ingenuity in saying the thing that was unexpected,
whether possible or impossible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because you’re carrying that flower-pot,” replied
the woman. “It’s such absurd sort of luggage to
be taking on a journey.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“How do you know I’m going on a journey?”
asked the gardener, astonished at meeting his match.
“By the expression of your heels.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener could think of nothing more apt to
say than “Tra-la-la&nbsp;...” so he said it, to let her
know that he was a merry vagabond.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman was quite plain, and therefore worthy
only of invisibility in the eyes of a self-respecting
young man. She had the sort of hair that plays
truant over the ears, but has not vitality enough to
do it prettily. Her complexion was not worthy of
the name. Her eyes made no attempt to redeem her
plainness, which is the only point of having eyes in
fiction. Her only outward virtue was that she did
not attempt to dress as if she were pretty. And even
this is not a very attractive virtue.</p>

<p class='c009'>She carried a mustard-coloured portmanteau.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know what you are,” said the gardener.
“You are a suffragette, going to burn a house down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How curious of you!” she said. “You are perfectly
right. Votes for women!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tra-la-la&nbsp;...” sang the gardener wittily.</p>

<p class='c009'>(You need not be afraid. There is not going to
be so very much about the cause in this book.)</p>

<p class='c009'>They walked some way in silence. The gardener,
of course, shared the views of all decent men on this
subject. One may virtuously destroy life in a good
cause, but to destroy property is a heinous crime,
whatever its motive.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>(Yes, I know that made you tremble, but there are
not many more paragraphs of it.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently they passed a car, pillowed against a
grassy bank. Its attitude, which looked depressed,
was not the result of a catastrophe, but of a picnic.
In the meadow, among the buttercups, could be seen
four female hats leaning together over a little square
meal set forth in the grass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look,” said the suffragette, in a voice thin with
scorn.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener looked, but could see nothing that
aroused in him a horror proportionate to his companion’s
tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen,” said the suffragette half an octave
higher.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener listened. But all he heard was,
“Oh, my dear, it was too killing....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, because the chauffeur on the bank paused
in mid-sandwich, as if about to rebuke their curiosity,
they walked on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One is born a woman,” said the suffragette.
“A woman in her sphere—which is the home.
One starts by thinking of one’s dolls, later one thinks
about one’s looks, and later still about one’s clothes.
But nobody marries one. And then one finds that
one’s sphere—which is the home—has been a
prison all along. Has it ever struck you that the
tragedy of a woman’s life is that she has time to think—she
can think and organise her sphere at the same
time. Her work never lets her get away from herself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>I tell you I have cried with disgust at the sound
of my own name—I won’t give it to you, but it
might as well be Jane Brown. I have gasped appalled
at the banality of my Sunday hat. Yet I kept
house excellently. And now I have run away, I am
living a wide and gorgeous life of unwomanliness.
I am trying to share your simplest privilege—the
privilege you were born to through no merit of your
own, you silly little boy—the privilege of having
interests as wide as the world if you like, and of
thinking to some purpose about England’s affairs.
My England. Are you any Englisher than I?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are becoming incoherent,” said the gardener.
“You are enjoying a privilege which you do
not share with me—the privilege of becoming hysterical
in public and yet being protected by the law.
You are a woman, and goodness knows that is privilege
enough. It covers everything except politics.
Also you have wandered from the point, which at one
time appeared to be a picnic.”</p>

<p class='c009'>(Courage. There is only a little more of this.
But you must allow the woman the privilege of
the last word. It is always more dignified to allow
her what she is perfectly certain to take in any
case.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“The picnic was an example of that sphere of
which ‘Oh, my dear, too killing&nbsp;...’ is the motto.
You educate women—to that. I might have been
under one of those four hats—only I’m not pretty
enough. You have done nothing to prevent it. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>might have been an ‘Oh, my dear’ girl, but thank
heaven I’m an incendiary instead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was the end of that argument. The gardener
could not reply as his heart prompted him, because
the arguments that pressed to his lips were too
obvious.</p>

<p class='c009'>Obviousness was the eighth deadly sin in his eyes.
He would have agreed with the Devil rather than
use the usual arguments in favour of virtue. That
was his one permanent pose.</p>

<p class='c009'>A little way off, on a low green hill, the suffragette
pointed out the home of a scion of sweated industry,
the house she intended to burn down. High trees
bowed to each other on either side of it, and a little
chalky white road struggled up to its door through
fir plantations, like you or me climbing the world for
a reward we never see.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry,” said the gardener. “I love a house
that looks up as that one does. I don’t like them
when they sit conceitedly surveying their ‘well-timbered
acres’ under beetle brows that hide the sky.
Don’t burn it. Look at it, holding up its trees like
green hands full of blessings.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In an hour or two the smoke will stand over it
like a tree—like a curse....”</p>

<p class='c009'>When they parted the gardener liked her a little
because she was on the wrong side of the law.
There is much more room for the wind to blow and
the sun to shine beyond the pale—or so it seems to
the gardener and me standing wistful and respectable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>inside. It is curious to me that one of the few remaining
illusions of romance should cling to a connection
with that most prosy of all institutions—the
law.</p>

<p class='c009'>I forgot to mention that the gardener borrowed a
shilling from the suffragette, thus rashly forming a
new link with the world in place of the one he had
relinquished to the girl Courtesy. The worst of the
world is that it remains so absurdly conservative, and
rudely ignores our interesting changes of pose and
of fantasy. I have been known to crave for a penny
bun in the middle of a visit from my muse, and that
is not my fault, but Nature’s, who created appetites
and buns for the common herd, and refused to adapt
herself to my abnormal psychology.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was interesting to the gardener to see how easily
the suffragette parted with such an important thing as
a shilling. Superfluity is such an incredible thing to
the hungry. The suffragette gave Holloway Gaol
as her permanent address.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus accidentally bribed, the gardener, feasting
on a cut from the joint in the next village, refrained
from discussing women, their rights or wrongs, or
their local intentions, with the village policeman.
“She won’t really dare do it,” he thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>(I may here add that I was not asked by a militant
society to write this book. I am writing it for your
instruction and my own amusement.)</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener did not sleep under a hedge as all
merry vagabonds do—(Tra-la-la)—but he slept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>in the very middle of a large field, much to the surprise
of the cows. One or two of these coffee-coloured
matrons awoke him at dawn by means of an
unwinking examination that would have put a lesser
man out of countenance. But the gardener, as becomes
a man attacked by the empty impertinences of
females, turned the other way and presently slept
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>He washed next morning near to where the cows
drank. He had no soap and the cows had no tumblers,—nothing
could have been more elemental
than either performance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very near to the heart of nature—tra-la-la,”
trilled the gardener. But the heart of nature
eludes him who tries to measure the distance. The
only beat that the gardener heard was the soft thud
of his own feet along the thick dust of the highway.</p>

<p class='c009'>About the next day but one he came to a place
where the scenery changed its mind abruptly, flung
buttercups and beeches behind it, and drew over its
shoulders the sombre cloak of heather and pines.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under an unremarkable pine tree, listening to the
impatient summons of the woodpecker (who, I
think, is the feathered soul of the foolish virgin outside
the bridegroom’s door), sat a man. He was
so fair that he might as well have been white-haired.
His eyes were like two copper sequins set between
white lashes, beneath white brows, in a white face.
His lips were very red, and if he had seemed more
detached and less friendly, he would have looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>like harlequin. But he rose from his seat on the
pine needles, and came towards the gardener, as
though he had been waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener steeled himself against the
stranger’s first word, fearing lest he should say,
“What a glorious day!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the stranger, making a spasmodic attempt to
remove a hat which had been left at home, said,
“My name is Samuel Rust, a hotel-keeper.
Won’t you come and look at my place?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was impossible for the gardener to do otherwise,
for Mr. Samuel Rust’s place framed itself in
a gap in the woods to the right, and was introduced
by a wave of its owner’s hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a red place!” said the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course. No other name is possible for it,”
said Mr. Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>The house was built of red brick that had much
tangerine colour in it. The flowering heather
surged to its very door-step. And thick around it
the slim pine tree-trunks shot up, like flame, whispered
flame.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener smiled at it. If only Hilda might
be the colour of those tree-trunks when she flowered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Rust acknowledged the smile in the name of
his red place. “It’s an—inoffensive little hole,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>What he meant was of course, “It’s a perfectly
exquisite spot.” What is becoming of our old eloquence
and enthusiasm? The full-blooded conventions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>are dying, and we have already replaced them
by a code of shadows. But whether the life beneath
the code is as vivid as ever, remains to be seen. I
think myself that manners are changing, but not
man. In all probability we shall live to greet the
day when “fairly decent” will express the most
ecstatic degree of rapture.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener was not intentionally modern. It
is the tendency of his generation to be modern—it
is difficult to believe that it has been the tendency
of every generation from the prehistoric downwards.
And it was the gardener’s ambition to walk
in the opposite direction to the tendency of his generation.
He shared the common delusion that by
walking apart he could be unique. This arises from
the divine fallacy that man makes man, that he has
the making of himself in his own hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am glad that I share this pathetic illusion with
my gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>So, as he thought the Red Place very beautiful, he
said, “I think it is very beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But even so he was not sincere throughout. He
posed even in his honesty. For he posed purposely
as an honest man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course you know that one of the most effective
poses is to pose as one who never poses. A rough
diamond with a heart of gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first moment Mr. Samuel Rust heard the gardener
say Tra-la-la he ceased to have a doubt as to
the species of citadel he had invaded.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“You are one of these insouciant wanderers,
what?” he suggested. “A light-hearted genius going
to make a fortune grow out of the twopence in
your pocket. You got yourself out of a book. I
think your sort make your hearts light by blowing
them up with gas.”</p>

<p class='c009'>True to his code, he then feared that he had
spoken with insufficient mediocrity, and blushed. A
small circular patch of red, like a rose, appeared high
up on either cheek, suddenly bringing the rest of
his face into competition with his vivid lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are wrong about the twopence,” said the
gardener, “I have three halfpence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come and see my Red Place,” said Mr. Rust.
“That is, if you’re not bored.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Boredom and the gardener were strangers. One
can never be bored if one is always busy creating
oneself with all the range of humanity as model.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is an hotel,” said the owner, as they approached
the door. “It is my hotel, and it
promised to make my fortune. So far it has confined
itself to costing a fortune. When I remind it
of its promise it puts its tongue in its cheek—what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The northern side of the Red Place was quite different
in character from the side which first smiled
on the gardener. This was because one essential
detail was lacking—the heather. Fire had passed
over the little space at some recent date in its sleepy
history, and had left it sinister. Tortured roots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and branches appealed from the black ground to a
blue heaven. The surrounding pine trees, with
their feet charred and blistered, and their higher
limbs still fiercely red, still looked like flames now
turned into pillars of delight in answer to the prayer
of the beseeching heather.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there anybody in your hotel?” asked the
gardener, smoothing his hair hopefully—the young
man’s invariable prelude to romance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nobody, except the gods,” replied the host.
“We sit here waiting, the divine and I. There is
a blessing on the place, and I intend to make money
out of it. You can see for yourself how wonderfully
good it is. If people knew of the peace and
the delight.... The table is excellent too—I
am the chef as well as the proprietor. Our terms
are most moderate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All the same you need advertisement,” said the
gardener, who, in unguarded moments, was more
modern than he knew. “I can imagine most sensational
advertising of a place with such a pronounced
blessing on it. Buy up the front page of the <cite>Daily
Mail</cite>, and let’s compose a series of splashes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am penniless,” began Mr. Rust dramatically,
and interrupted himself. “A slight tendency
towards financial inadequacy—what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have three halfpence,” said the gardener, but
not hopefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come in for the night,” begged the host. “I
have twelve bedrooms for you to sleep in, and three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>bathrooms tiled in red. Terms a halfpenny, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout
compris</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tra-la-la&nbsp;...” trilled the gardener, for as he
followed his host the heather tingled and tossed beneath
his feet, and the gods came out to meet him
with a red welcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have nothing to do—what?” said Mr.
Samuel Rust, when they were sitting in the high russet
hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We-ll&nbsp;...” answered the gardener, feeling
that the suggestion of failure lurked there. “I am a
rover, you know. Busy roving.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To say that shows you haven’t roved sixty miles
yet. When you’ve roved six hundred you’ll see
there’s nothing to be got out of roving. When
you’ve roved six thousand you’ll join the Travellers’
Club and be glad it’s all over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Six thousand miles&nbsp;...” said the gardener, as
if it were a prayer. His heart looked and leapt
towards the long, crowded perspective that those
words hinted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve never been to sea,” continued Mr.
Samuel. And the gardener discovered with a jerk
that he was a blue man born for the sea, and that he
had never yet felt the swing of blue water beneath
his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” he said, “I believe I must go there now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And he jumped to his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you stay here for the night,” said Mr. Rust,
“to-morrow I’ll suggest to you something that—may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>possibly interest you to some slight extent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a clumsy blood-red pottery candlestick,
which was so careless in detail as to seem to be the
unconscious production of a drunken master-potter,
the gardener found his room.</p>

<p class='c009'>(I know it is a shock to you to find it bedtime at
this point, but the gardener and I forgot to notice
those parts of the day which I have not mentioned.)</p>

<p class='c009'>He dreamt of red hair, redder than natural, as
red as a sunset, seen at close quarters from Paradise.
At midnight he awoke, in the clutch of perfectly irrelevant
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>The room was a velvet cube, with the window
plastered at one side of it, a spangled square. And
the silken moonlight was draped across the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am myself,” said the gardener. “I am my
world. Nothing matters except me. I am the creator
and the created.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With which happy thought he returned to sleep
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Red Place lost its flame-like life at night.
Night, that blind angel, has no dealings with colour,
and turns even the auburn of the pine-trunks to cold
silver. But before the gardener awoke again, the
sun had roused the gods of the place to discover the
theft of their red gold, and to replace it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener, as he trilled like a lark in one of
the red-tiled bathrooms, was suddenly reminded that
he was a merry vagabond.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must disappear,” he thought. “No true vagabond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>ever says, ‘Good-bye, and thank you for my
pleasant visit.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>So he prepared to disappear. From his bedroom
window he could see, as he dressed, the pale head
of Mr. Samuel Rust on a far fir-crowned slope, looking
away over the green land towards London, waiting,
side by side with the divine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener took three slices of dry bread from
the breakfast which waited expectantly on a table
in the hall, and went out. But under a gorse bush
amongst the heather, he found some tiny scarlet
flowers. He picked two or three, and returning put
them on the breakfast plate of Mr. Samuel Rust.
He put a halfpenny there too.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very vagabondish—tra-la-la&nbsp;...” he murmured
tunefully, and studied the infinitesimal effect
with his head on one side.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he disappeared. He did it straightforwardly
along the open road, as the best vagabonds
do, and he was pleased with his fidelity to the
part.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently he recalled for the first time Mr. Samuel
Rust’s promise of a happy suggestion for that morning.
For a moment he wondered, for a second he
regretted, but he posed as being devoid of curiosity.
This is a good pose, for in time it comes true. It
eventually withers the little silly tentacles which at
first it merely ignores. Curiosity needs food as
much as any of us, and dies soon if denied it. And
I am glad, for it seems to me that curiosity and spite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>are very closely akin, and that spite is very near to
the bottom of the pit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The memory of Mr. Rust’s remark, however,
kept the gardener for some moments busy being
incurious. He was not altogether successful in his
pose, for when the pallid owner of the Red Place
stepped out of a thicket in front of him, he thought
with a secret quiver, “Now I shall know what it
was....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Taking a morning walk—what?” remarked
Mr. Rust, achieving his ambition, the commonplace,
for once in perfection.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” replied the gardener (one who never told
a lie unless he was posing as a liar), “I was leaving
you. I have left a smile of thanks and a halfpenny
on your plate. You know I’m a rover, an incurable
vagabond, and my fraternity never disappears in an
ordinary way in the station fly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is rather tiresome to have to explain one’s
poses. It is far worse than having to explain one’s
witticisms, and that is bad enough.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come back to breakfast,” said Samuel. “I can
let you into a much more paying concern than vagabondage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not in the least impressive to disappear by
brute force in public, so the gardener turned back.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gods did not run out to meet the returning
vagabond, as they had run out to meet him arriving.
The gardener did not look for them. He was too
much occupied in thinking of small cramping things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>like “paying concerns.” The expression sounded
to him like a foggy square room papered in a drab
marbled design.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A paying concern does not interest me at all,”
he said, feeling rather noble.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It won’t as long as you’re a merry vagabond.
But your situation as such is not permanent, I think.
Wouldn’t you like to go and strike attitudes upon
the sea?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener was intensely interested in what
followed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Samuel Rust was penniless, owing, as he
frankly admitted, to propensities which he shared
with the common sieve. But in other directions he
was well supplied with blessings. He had, for instance,
a mother. And the mother—well, you
know, she managed to scrape along on nine thousand
a year—what? The said mother, excellent woman
though she was, had refused to finance the Red
Place. She had not come within the radius of its
blessing. She had no idea that it was under the
direct patronage of the gods, and that it promised a
fortune in every facet. Samuel had explained these
facts to her, but she had somehow gathered the impression
that he was not unbiassed. In her hand she
held the life of the Red Place, and at present held it
checked. A little money for advertisement, a few
hundred pounds to set the heart of the place beating,
and Samuel Rust saw himself a successful man,
standing with his gods on terms of equality. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>his mother had become inaccessible, she had in fact
become so wearied by the conversation of Samuel
upon the subject that she had made arrangements
to emigrate to Trinity Islands, somewhere on the
opposite side of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what is it to do with me?” asked the gardener,
who suffered from the drawbacks of his paramount
virtue, enthusiasm, and never could wait for
the end of anything. “Do you want me to turn
into an unscrupulous rogue and dog her footsteps
because——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can have scruples or not as you choose,”
said Mr. Rust. “But rogue is a word that exasperates
me. It’s much the same as ‘naughty-naughty,’
and that is worse than wickedness. The
wicked live on brimstone, which is at least honest;
but the naughty-naughty play with it, which is irreverent.
With or without your scruples, armed only
with the blessing and the promise of this place, I
want you to cross the Atlantic on the <em>Caribbeania</em>
with my mother, and tell her what it is the gods and
I are waiting for. That is—just try and talk the
old lady round—don’t you know. Any old
twaddle would do—what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener produced two halfpennies, one of
which he placed on each knee.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the fare first-class is&nbsp;...” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have a cousin whose only virtue is that he
occasionally serves the purpose of coin,” said Mr.
Rust. “That is—I know a fellow I can bleed to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>certain extent—what? He is the son of—well,
a middling K-nut at the top of the shipping tree—what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener had visions of an unscrupulous
rogue, neatly packed into a crate labelled champagne,
being smuggled on board the <em>Caribbeania</em>.
Truly the pose had possibilities. The affair was,
however, vague at present, and the gardener retained,
whatever the rôle he was playing, an accurate
mind and a profound respect for the exactness of
words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will he stow me away?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not in the way you mean. But there’ll be room
for you on the <em>Caribbeania</em>. Come down to Southampton
with me now. There’s a train at noon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have my own feet, and a good white road,”
replied the gardener in a poetic voice. “I’ll join
you in Southampton this evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s thirty-five miles,” said Mr. Rust. “And
the boat sails to-morrow morning. However....
We haven’t discussed the business side of the affair
yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we never will. I’ll take my payment out
in miles—an excellent currency.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In spite of the distance of his destination, the gardener
stood by his determination to go by road. A
friendly farmer’s cart may always be depended on
to assist the pose of a vagabond. It would have
been extremely hackneyed to approach the opening
door of life by train. So he left his blessing with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the Red Place, and shook the hand of its white master,
and set his face towards the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was still early. The sun had set the long limbs
of the tree-shadows striding about the woods; the
gorse, a tamed expression of flame, danced in the
yellow heat; the heather pressed like a pigmy army
bathed in blood about the serene groups of pines.
There was great energy abroad, which kept the air
a-tingle. The gardener almost pranced along.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently he came to a woman seated by the roadside
engrossed in a box of matches.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You again,” said the gardener to the suffragette,
for he recognised her by her hat. There was a
bunch of promiscuous flowers attached to her hat.
They were of an unsuitable colour, and looked as
though they had taken on their present situation as
an after-thought, when the hat was already well
advanced in years. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A mariage de convenance.</span></i></p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you any matches?” was the suffragette’s
characteristic reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never give away my matches to people with
political opinions without making the fullest enquiries,”
replied the gardener. “People are not
careful enough about the future morals of their innocent
matches in these days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Forgetting the thirty-five miles, he sat down on
the bank beside her, and began to refresh Hilda by
splashing the water into her pot out of a tiny heathery
stream that explored the roadside ditch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can supply you with all particulars at once,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>said the suffragette in a businesslike voice. “I am
going to burn down a little red empty hotel that
stands in the woods behind you. There is only one
man in charge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are not,” said the gardener, descending
suddenly to unfeigned sincerity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly it is not the home of an Anti,” continued
the suffragette, ignoring his remark. “At
least as far as I know. But you never can tell. A
Cabinet Minister might want to come and stay there
any time; there are good golf-links. I had hoped
that the last affair, the burning of West Grove—a
most successful business—would have been my last
protest for the present. I meant to be arrested, and
spend a month or two at the not less important work
of setting the teeth of the Home Office on edge.
But the police are disgracefully lax in this part of
the world, and though I left several clues and flourished
my portmanteau in three neighbouring villages,
nothing happened. I do not like to give myself
up, it is so inartistic, and people are apt to translate
it as a sign of repentance. But the little hotel
is a splendid opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the drawbacks of posing yourself is that
you are apt to become a little blind to the poses of
others. Also you must remember that women, and
especially rebellious women, were an unexplored
continent to the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are not going to take advantage of the opportunity,”
said the gardener, refreshing Hilda so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>violently that she stood up to her knees in water.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve heard the caretaker is constantly out&nbsp;...”
went on the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Possibly,” admitted the gardener. “But if the
house were twenty times alone, you should not light
a match within a mile of it. How dare you—you
a great strong woman—to take advantage of the
weak gods who can’t defend themselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The great strong woman crinkled her eyes at him.
She was absurdly small and thin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if you won’t lend me any matches, I shall
have to try and do with the three I have. I am
going to reconnoitre. Good-morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There is nothing so annoying as to have one’s
really impressive remarks absolutely ignored. I
myself can bear a great deal of passing over. You
may with advantage fail to see my complexion and
the cut of my clothes; you may be unaware of the
colour of my eyes without offending me; I do not
care if you never take the trouble to depress your
eyes to my feet to see if I take twos or sevens; you
may despise my works of art—which have no value
except in the eyes of my relations; you may refuse to
read my writings—which have no value in any eyes
but my own,—all these things you may do and still
retain my respect, but when I speak you must listen
to what I say. If you don’t, I hate you.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener felt like this, and the retreating
form of the suffragette became hateful to him.
Somehow delightfully hateful.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“Come back,” he shouted, but incredible though
it may seem, the woman shrugged one shoulder at
him, and walked on towards the Red Place.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was most undignified, the gardener had to run
after her to enforce his will. He arrived by her
side breathless, with his face the colour of a slightly
anæmic beetroot. It is very wrong of women to
place their superiors in such unsuperior positions.</p>

<p class='c009'>I hope I do not strike you as indulging my suffragettism
at the expense of the gardener. I am
very fond of him myself, and because that is so, his
conceit seems to me to be one of his principal
charms. There is something immorally attractive
in a baby vice that makes one’s heart smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener closed his hand about the suffragette’s
thin arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will force me to take advantage of my privilege,”
he said, and looked at his own enormous
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette stood perfectly still, looking in
the direction she wanted to go.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Turn back,” said the gardener. But she made
a sudden passionate effort to twist her arm out of his
grasp. It was absurd, and very nearly successful,
like several things that women do.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener’s heart grew black. There seemed
nothing to be done. No end could be imagined to
the incident. His blue sea future dissolved. He
pictured himself standing thus throughout eternity,
with his hand closed around the little splinter of life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>she called her arm. Time seemed to pass so slowly
that in a minute he found he knew her looks by
heart. And yet he was not weary of them. I suppose
the feeling he found in himself was due to a certain
reaction from the exalted incident of the blue
and golden young lady who had divined the loneliness
of the threepenny bit. For he discovered that
he did not so very much mind hair that had but little
colour in it, and that he found attractive a pointed
chin, and an under lip that was the least trifle more
out-thrust than its fellow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know why I want to stop you?” he said
at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because you are not a woman, and don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I am a man, and I understand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know what I mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t. I mean that I am a man, and I
am not going to let you go, because you must come
with me to the uttermost ends of the earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I love the shape of your face, you dear
little thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gods should not be disturbed. Also there
was something very potent in the impotent trembling
of her arm.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>There was an unnaturally long pause. Then she
turned round.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us discuss this matter,” she said, and gave
him her portmanteau to carry. The gardener
loosed her arm and walked beside her. Silence and
a distance of a yard and a half were maintained between
them for some way.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener was gazing in blank astonishment
at that ass, the gardener of three minutes ago. Into
what foolery had he not plunged?</p>

<p class='c009'>If I could always be the Woman I Am, I should
be a most rational and successful creature. It is the
Woman I Was who makes a fool of me, and leaves
me nervous as to the possible behaviour of the
Woman I Shall Be.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was something in the way the suffragette’s
neck slipped loosely into her collar which took a little
of the sting out of the gardener’s regrets. But the
little plain eyes of her, and the aggressive manners
of her, and the misguided morals of her—that was
the sequence in which the gardener’s thoughts fell
into line.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for the suffragette, her heart, in defiance of
anatomy, had gone to her head, and was thundering
rhythmically there. She was despising herself passionately,
and congratulating herself passionately.
How grand—she thought: how contemptible—she
thought. For she was a world’s worker, a
wronged unit seeking rights, a co-heritor of the
splendour of the earth, a challenger, a warrior.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>And now, quite suddenly, she discovered a fact the
existence of which she had seldom, even in weak moments,
suspected. She found that—taken off her
guard—she was a young woman of six-and-twenty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How laughable,” she thought—and did not
laugh—“I’m as bad as the ‘Oh my dear’ girls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” she said at last, “what did you mean by
that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only that you look like a good friend,” replied
the gardener, who, poor vagabond, was blushing
furiously. “Mightn’t we be friends?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am a friend to women,” said the suffragette
slowly. “I’m a lover of women. But never of
men. I wouldn’t stir an inch out of my way for a
man. Unless I wanted to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do you want to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at the gardener’s profile with the eyes
of the newly discovered young woman of six-and-twenty.
Hitherto she had seen him only with the
militant eyes of armed neutrality. She looked at
the rather pleasing restlessness of his eyes, and the
high tilt of his head. His eyes were not dark with
meaning, as the eyes of heroes of novels should be,
they were light and quick. The black pupils looked
out fierce and sharp, like the pupils of a cat, which
flash like black sparks out of the twilight of its soul.
The gardener’s eyes actually conveyed little, but
they looked like blinds, barely concealing something
of great value.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently the suffragette said: “Can you imagine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>what you feel like if you had been running in a
race, and you had believed you were winning. The
rest were miles behind wasting their breath variously;
and then suddenly your eyes were opened,
and you saw that you had been running outside the
ropes of the course, for you were never given the
chance to enter for the competition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” said the gardener enthusiastically.
“So you’re tired of running to no purpose, and
you’re coming back to the starting-place to begin
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said the suffragette, as firmly as though
she had the muscular supremacy and could start back
that moment to pit her three matches against the
gods. “Never. There’s no such thing as running
to no purpose. It’s excellent exercise—running,
but I’ll never run with the crowd. There are much
better things than winning the prize. There’s more
of everything out here—more air, more light, more
comedy, more tragedy. Also I get there first, you
know. When you get the law-abider and the
church-goer in a crowd, they increase its moral tone,
but they lessen its power of covering the ground.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Personally I never was inside,” said the gardener,
who had a natural preference for talking
about himself. “But then I am building a path of
my own.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anyway, what did you mean originally?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener blushed again. He showered reproaches
on himself. “Only that we might walk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>into Southampton as friends. And if we liked
it.... Besides I owe you a shilling, and you’d better
keep an eye on your financial interests. My boat
sails to-morrow. You know, it is a nice shock to me
to find that a militant suffragette is human at all.
When I held your arm, I was surprised to find it was
not iron.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you say your boat sailed to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should have said, ‘Our boat sails to-morrow.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s no time to walk. We’ll hire a car in
Aldershot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So at sunset, side by side, they arrived in sight
of Southampton’s useful but hackneyed sheet of
water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even then they had no plans. In youth one likes
the feeling of standing on empty air with a blank in
front of one.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette paid for the car without question.
“I am quite well off,” she excused herself, as they
traversed the smug and comfortless suburbs of the
town. “Has that shilling I lent you to invest
brought in any interest?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hate money,” posed the gardener; “but I have
a profession, you know. I am a gardener.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And where is your garden?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have two. This is one”—and he held up
Hilda, who was looking rather round-shouldered
owing to the exertions and emotions of the day—“and
the world is the other. It also happens that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>I have had three months’ training in a horticultural
college.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener did not talk like this naturally, any
more than you or I do. But in addition to his many
other poses he posed as being unique. Unfortunately
there is nothing entirely unique except insanity.
Of course there are better things than insanity.
On the other hand, it is rather vulgar to be perfectly
sane.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette went to an hotel, and the gardener
went to meet Mr. Samuel Rust at their appointed
meeting-place.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Rust looked even more colourless against the
brownness of the town than he had seemed against
the redness of his place. He wore town clothes,
too, and one noticed them, which is what one does
not do with a well-dressed man. The ideal, of
course, is to look as if the Almighty made you to
fit your clothes. There are a great many unfortunates
whose appearance persists in confessing the
truth—that the tailor made their clothes to fit
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Samuel Rust, however, was not self-conscious.
He escaped that pitfall, but left other
people to be conscious of his appearance for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come along,” he said, skipping up to the gardener
like a goat, or like a little hill. “I’ve
sounded my cousin on the telephone, and the outlook
is not otherwise than middling hopeful. He’s
promised, in fact, to ship you on board the <em>Caribbeania</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>The question is—what as? What can
you do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am a gardener—in theory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unfortunately only facts are shipped on Abel’s
line.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then all is over. For I am just a sheaf of
theories held together by a cage of bones. There
is no fact in me at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be humble. It’s waste of time in such a
humiliating world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not humble”—the gardener indignantly
repudiated the suggestion. “I’m proud of being
what I am. I am more than worthy of the <em>Caribbeania</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then come and prove it,” said Mr. Rust, and
dragged the gardener passionately down the street.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener found himself placed on the door-step
of an aspiring corner house. Mr. Samuel
Rust stood on a lower step with his back to the door.
It is part of the code of shadows to pretend, when
you have rung the bell, that you do not care whether
the door is opened or not.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener, following the code of the socially
simple, stood with his nose nearly touching the
knocker, and his eyes glued to the spot where the
head of the servant might be expected to appear.
It therefore devolved on him to draw Mr. Rust’s
attention to the eventual appearance of a black-frocked
white-capped answer to his summons.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” exclaimed Samuel, “Mr. Abel in?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The maid, with fine dramatic feeling, stepped
aside, thus opening up a vista, at the end of which
could be seen Mr. Abel advancing with both hands
outstretched.</p>

<p class='c009'>When people shake hands with both their hands
and both their eyes and all their teeth, and with
much writhing of the lips, you at once know something
fairly important about them. They have acquired
the letter of enthusiasm without its spirit, and
their effect on the really enthusiastic is like the effect
of artificial light and heat on a flower that needs the
sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener became as though he were not there.
All that he vouchsafed to leave at Mr. Rust’s side in
the library of Mr. Abel was a white and sleepy-looking
young man, standing on one fourteen-inch
foot while the other carefully disarranged the carpet
edge. The gardener was not shy, though on
such occasions he looked silly. He was really encrusted
in himself; loftily superior to Mr. Abel and
his like he hung, levitated by the medium of his own
conceit, at a level far above Mr. Abel’s house-top.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately Mr. Abel and Mr. Rust both took
his aloofness for the sheepishness to be expected of
one of his age.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is the instrument of my designs, and the
victim of your kindness, Abel,” remarked Mr. Rust.
“He doesn’t always look such an ass. He is a
gardener, by profession.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“In theory,” added the gardener, whose armour
of aloofness had chinks. There is something practical
about this inconsistent young man which he has
never yet succeeded in smothering, and to this day,
though he poses as being superbly absent-minded, his
mind is generally present—so to speak—behind
the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In theory,” repeated Mr. Abel, ecstatically
amused. He made it his business to shoot promiscuous
appreciation at the conversation of his betters,
and though his aim was not good, he was at least
gifted with perseverance. If you shoot enough, you
must eventually hit something. Hereafter he kept
his profile agog towards the gardener, a smile hovering
round that side of his mouth in readiness for
his guest’s next sally.</p>

<p class='c009'>One pose in which the gardener has never approached
is that of the wag, and he made renewed
efforts to unhook his mind from this exasperating
interview.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there any opening for a gardener on the
<em>Caribbeania</em>?” asked Mr. Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A gardener&nbsp;...” said Mr. Abel, looking laboriously
reflective. “We have no gardener as yet
on board.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But is there a garden?” asked Mr. Samuel Rust
acutely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A garden,” repeated Mr. Abel, ruminating intensely.
“There is the winter garden. And a row
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of geraniums on the promenade deck. And some
trellis work with ivy. Yes, there is certainly a garden.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the thing is settled,” said Mr. Rust, and
at these hopeful words the gardener rose loudly
from his chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait a moment,” said Mr. Abel in the same
voice as the voice in which Important Note is printed
in the Grammar Book. “What about the salary?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no reply and no sensation. The gardener
was yearning towards the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course....” said Mr. Abel. “The position
is not one of any responsibility, and therefore
could hardly be expected to be a paying one. Your
passage out....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wouldn’t touch money. I hate the feel of it,”
said the gardener abruptly. That threw Mr. Abel
into a paroxysm of humour.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the door-step the gardener did a heroic thing.
He turned back and found Mr. Abel in the hall, completely
recovered from his paroxysm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about——” began the gardener, with the
suffragette in his mind. “Dangerous to lose sight
of her,” he thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about what?” asked Mr. Abel, and was
again very much amused by the symmetry of the
phrase. He was a bright-mannered man.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener’s new pose lay suddenly clear before
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about my wife?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>He was rather pleased with the sensation he made.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your wife?” exclaimed Mr. Rust and Mr.
Abel in duet (falsetto and tenor).</p>

<p class='c009'>“What on earth did you do with her last night?”
continued Samuel solo.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t she ship as stewardess?” asked the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor suffragette! But in the eyes of men one
woman is much the same as another. Every woman,
I gather, is a potential stewardess. This is woman’s
sphere when it takes to the water. The gardener
thought he knew all about women. All her virtues
he considered that she shared with man, but her
vices he looked upon as peculiarly her own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The boat sails to-morrow,” Mr. Abel observed
reproachfully. “The stewardesses have been engaged
for weeks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why can’t you leave her behind, what?” asked
Mr. Rust. “Women do far too much travelling
about nowadays. There’s such a thing as broadening
the mind too far, you know. Sometimes, like
elastic, it snaps. A lot of women I know have
snapped.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said the gardener. “But it would be
better for England if I took her away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This spark nearly put an end to the career of
Mr. Abel. He squeezed the gardener’s hand in an
agony of appreciation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t go without her,” said the gardener,
rather surprising himself. He gave Mr. Abel no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>answering smile. He was too busy reproaching himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Abel,” implored Mr. Rust. “I simply can’t
let old Mrs. Paul go without some one to keep the
Red Place in her line of thought. This is obviously
the man for the job. My career hangs on you. Be
worthy. That is—be a sport, now, what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll find your wife a berth,” said Mr. Abel,
accompanying each word with a dramatic tap on the
gardener’s arm. “The boat is not full.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Settled,” exclaimed Mr. Samuel, and after that,
of course, escape followed. The idea of dinner together
hovered between the two as they emerged
into the principal street, but as both were penniless,
the idea, which originated chiefly in instinct, died.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener went to call on the suffragette. He
was conscientious in his own way, and fully realised
that the woman had a right to know that she was
now a wife, and, if not a stewardess, an intending
passenger on a boat bound immediately for the uttermost
ends of the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found the suffragette, looking sad, playing a
forlorn game of solitaire in forlorn surroundings in
the little hotel sitting-room. With her hat off she
looked not so ugly, but more insignificant. Her hair
seemed as if it would never decide whether to be
fair or dark until greyness overtook it and settled
the question. It had been tidied under protest, and
already strands of it were creeping over her ears,
like deserters leaving a fortress by stealth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>The room was papered and ceiled and upholstered
in drab, there were also drab photographs of unlovable
bygones on the walls, and some drab artificial
flowers in a drab pot on the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are some colour schemes that kill romance.
Directly the gardener felt the loveless air of the
place, he plunged headlong into the cold interview.
Like a bather who, on feeling the chill of the sea,
hastens desperately to throw it around him from
head to foot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been telling lies,” said the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been crying,” said the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>They each thought that it was thoughtless of the
other to be so egotistical at this juncture. There
is nothing that kills an effect so infallibly as a collision
in conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been telling lies,” said the gardener,
“about you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been crying—about you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>(These women....)</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener took a deep breath, recoiled for a
start, and ran upon his subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have told them that you are my wife, and that
you are coming with me on the <em>Caribbeania</em>, sailing
to-morrow morning for Trinity Islands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Told who&nbsp;... <em>Caribbeania</em>&nbsp;... Trinity Islands
...” gathered the suffragette, with a woman’s
instinct for tripping over the least essential
point. And then she interviewed herself laboriously
on the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>There was ample motive for a militant protest,
and that was a comfortable thought. She was justified
in throwing any article of the drab furniture
at the gardener’s sharp and doubtful face. This
creature had put himself in authority over her without
the authority to do so; he had decided to lead
her to Trinity Islands, whereas her life’s work lay
in England. This cold and curious boy had twisted
off its hinges the destiny of an independent woman.
She had hitherto closed the door of her heart against
to-morrow. She had momentarily liked the idea of
having a friend who loved the shape of her face,
especially as he was leaving the country to-morrow.
The unconventionality of the friendship had crowned
as an ornament a life of dreadful refinement. She
had meant to step for a moment from the lonely path,
and now she found that her way back was barred—by
this impenetrable trifle. It was infuriating. But
the suffragette searched in vain for a trace of real
fury in her heart. She tested the power of words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is infuriating,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said the gardener, not apologetically.
“I quite see that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But she did not see it herself—except in theory.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All the same,” said the gardener, “you are an
incendiary, not exactly a woman. Can’t two friends,
an incendiary and a horticultural expert, go on a
voyage of exploration together? Mutual exploration?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One can be alone in couples,” thought the suffragette.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“It would be studying loneliness from a new
angle. My life has been a lifeless thing, run on the
world’s principles; I shall try a new line, and run it
on my own principles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But, as I may have mentioned, she was a woman,
so she said: “What is to prevent my going back
to that house in the woods now, and burning it down—if
I ever meant to do it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me,” said the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you can’t sit there with your eyes pinned to
me until the boat sails.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless you give me your word as a World’s
Worker that you will not leave the hotel, I shall
stay here, and so will you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For quite a long time the suffragette’s upbringing
wrestled with all comers, but it was a hopeless fight
from the first. There is no strength in the principles
created out of a lifeless past. Besides, the
woman of six-and-twenty was very much flattered
and fluttered, whatever the militant suffragette might
be.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will come with you on your exploration tour,”
she said, and her voice sounded like the voice of the
conqueror rather than the conquered. “I will give
my word as a—woman without principles that I
will not leave Southampton except to go on board the
<em>Caribbeania</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener left her, he felt innocently drunk.
He made his way out of the amethyst light of electricity,
into the golden light of the outskirts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>town, and thence into the silver light of the uncivilised
moon. On the beach the tide was receding,
despite the groping, grasping hands of the sea, which
contested every inch of the withdrawal. The gardener
stumbled upon the soft solidity of the sand
above high-water mark, and slept the sleep of the
thoroughly confused. He dreamt of a pearl-and-pink
sea, and of unknown islands.</p>

<p class='c009'>I need hardly say, after all this preamble, that the
suffragette and the gardener sailed next day on the
<em>Caribbeania</em> for Trinity Islands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Samuel Rust, for some time before the boat
started, was conspicuous for a marked non-appearance
on the wharf’s edge.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener, who had a vague feeling that tears
should be shed in England on his departure, stood
feeling a little cold at heart on the starboard side
of the main deck, looking at the tears that were being
shed for other people.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette, who was under the impression
that her hand was against all men, stood bleakly on
the port side, looking at the hydro-aeroplanes leaping
self-consciously about the Solent in seven-league
boots. She was proud to stand thus aloof and unhampered
on the threshold of a novelty. The pride
she had in her independence was one of her compensations.
This is a world of compensations, and that
is what makes it the hollow world it is sometimes.
So seldom do we get the real thing that in this age
we congratulate ourselves upon our compensations.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Mr. Samuel Rust made a late and dramatic appearance
upon the gangway after the first bell of
preparation for departure had been rung. His hat,
inspired by the prevalent aviation craze, blew away.
But Mr. Rust’s thoughts were occupied with other
things than the infidelity of hats. He passed the
gardener without noticing him, and with restrained
fervour addressed a square elderly woman, who
stood leisurely on the deck, surrounded by an officious
maid, like a liner being attended to by a tug.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Samuel Rust did not seem like the sort of
person who would have had a mother. He gave the
impression of having been created exactly as he
stood, with one stroke of the Almighty Finger, and
not gradually evolved like you or me. You could
imagine the gardener, for instance, at every stage of
his existence. You could picture those light bright
eyes under those scowling brows looking out of lace
and baby-ribbons in a proud nurse’s arms. You
could see him as the fierce little schoolboy, with alternately
too much to say and too little. You could
imagine him as an old man, with that thick hair
turned into a white strong flame upon his head, and
those already deep-set eyes blazing out of hewn
hollows above his abrupt cheek-bones. But Mr.
Samuel Rust seemed to have no past and no future.</p>

<p class='c009'>He addressed the woman who, contrary to appearances,
had played an important part in the creating
of him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“I couldn’t let you go without saying good-bye
to you, Mrs. Paul,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course you couldn’t,” said Mrs. Rust, and
the words seemed shot by iron lips from above a
chin like a ship’s ram.</p>

<p class='c009'>Something that might have usurped the name of
a kiss passed between them, and Mr. Samuel hurried
to the impatient gangway. As he passed the gardener
he winked earnestly, conscious of his mother’s
eyes on the back of his head. The gardener, feeling
delightfully unscrupulous and roguish, made no
sign.</p>

<p class='c009'>The vulgarly tuneful swan-songs of Cockney emotion
trailed from the deck to the wharf and back
again. The sound was like thin beaten silver, becoming
thinner as the distance increased. There
were tears among the women on land, and the shivering
water blurred the reflections of the crowd until
they looked as though they were seen through tears.
The last song fainted in the air, the crowd on the
wharf ceased to be human, and became a long suggestion
of many colours, a-quiver with waving handkerchiefs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener looked at Mrs. Paul Rust. There
was a tear following one of the furious furrows that
bracketed her hyphen of a mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The south of England is a land that reluctantly
lets her deserters go. For full twelve hours she
stands on tiptoe on the sea-line, beckoning their return.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>The gardener watched the land and felt the sea
for long hours. He felt no regret at having forsaken
one for the other. For the moment he prided
himself on heartlessness, or rather on intactness of
heart, for he had left none of it behind. He was
proud of the fact that he loved no one in the world.
He prided himself on his vices more than on his
virtues. There seems something more unique in
vice than in virtue.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener had the convenient sort of memory
that is fitted with water-tight doors. His mind conducted
a process by which the past was not kept fresh
and green, nor altogether left behind, but crystallised
and packed away on shelves in a businesslike manner.
He could label it and shut it away without
emotion. He shut away England now, and rejoiced
to do so. Poor grey silly England that I am so glad
to leave and so glad to see again....</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener turned presently to look for his
garden, and found—the girl Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her brilliant and magnetic hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her broad face with the abrupt flush on the cheeks,
that was an inartistic accompaniment to the red of
her hair, and looked as if Nature had become colourblind
at the moment of giving Courtesy her complexion.</p>

<p class='c009'>She herself looked herself—simple yet sophisticated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To think of seeing you here,” she said. “Who
would have thought it.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>The gardener was one of those who are never
surprised without being thunderstruck. He was
very thorough in habit, and drank every emotion to
its dregs.</p>

<p class='c009'>His manners fell in ruins about him. His hat
remained upon his head. His words remained somewhere
beneath his tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I got a sudden invitation from a cousin in Trinity
Island,” explained Courtesy. “And Dad gave
me my passage out as a birthday present. I gave
the threepenny bit to a porter, so I hope you don’t
want it back. Have you kept a halo for me in this
Paradise?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is the glassy sea,” replied the gardener,
recovering. “And the halo is just flowering. It
is exactly the colour of your hair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope the sea will be as you say,” said Courtesy,
“for I’m a shockin’ bad sailor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And at that moment the sea ceased to be totally
glassy. You could suddenly feel the slow passionate
heart of the sea beating.</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy did not look at the change in this poetic
light at all. She hurried along the deck and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even if you are a good sailor there is, apart from
a natural pride in your sailorship, little joy about a
first day on board. The climate of the English seas
is not adapted to ocean travel. If I could steam
straight out of Southampton Harbour into the strong
yet restrained heat that I love, if I could glide from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the wharf—mottled with regrets—straight to the
silver and emerald coasts of a certain land I know,
where the cocoanut palms lean out over the strip of
immaculate sand, to see their reflections in the opal
mirror of the sea, I think I should love the first day
as much as I love its successors. And yet I would
not have the voyage shortened by a minute.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wonder why nobody has ever brought forward
as a conclusive Anti-suffrage argument the fact that
more women are sea-sick than men on the first day
of a sea-voyage. I can so well imagine the superb
line the logic of such a contention would take. If
the basis of life is physical ability, and if physical
ability depends upon the digestion, then must the
strong digestion only constitute a right to citizenship.
To the wall with the weak digestion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Paul Rust and the suffragette were the only
women who scaled the heights of the dining saloon
for that evening’s meal. Mrs. Rust looked supremely
proud of her immunity from sea-sickness; all
the men looked laboriously unaware that such a thing
as sea-sickness existed; the suffragette looked frankly
miserable. The gardener was obliged to remind
himself casually from time to time that there was no
pose that included sea-sickness.</p>

<p class='c009'>But any disastrous tendency he might have had to
give too much thought to his inner man was checked
by the appearance of Mrs. Paul Rust, the fortress he
was there to besiege. She was a truly remarkable
woman to look at. The absence of her hat revealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>a surprise. Her hair was dyed a forcible crimson.
And it might have been mud-coloured like mine for
all the self-consciousness she showed. It was so profoundly
remarkable that for a time one’s attention
was chained to the hair, and one forgot to study the
impressive general effect, of which the hair was only
the culminating point. Mrs. Rust’s only real
feature was her chin, but no one ever realised this.
Her eyes and nose were too small for her face, and
seemed to fit loosely into that great oval; her mouth
was only redeemed by the chin that shot from beneath
it. Altogether she would have been sufficiently
insignificant-looking had it not been for her
hair. She proved the truism that the world takes
people at their own valuation.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is always a surprise to me when a truism is
proved true. I have come across the rock embedded
in these truisms several times lately to my cost. And
each time it bruises my knuckles and shocks me. It
almost makes one wonder whether, after all, the
ancients occasionally had their flashes of enlightenment.</p>

<p class='c009'>The world thought of Mrs. Paul Rust what she
thought of herself. It is so often too busy to work
out its own conclusions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of a modest woman with a heavy jaw, the world
would have said, “A dear good creature, but dreadfully
underhung.” Of a well-chinned woman with
dyed hair, it said, “There goes a strong character.”
The hair did it, and the hair was dyed by human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>agency. Providence had no hand in the making of
Mrs. Rust’s forcible reputation. Nowadays we
leave it to our dressmaker, and our manicurist, and
our milliner, and our doctor, and our vicar, to make
us what we are. This is an age of luxury, and it is
so fatiguing to assert a home-made personality.
Shall I go to my hairdresser and say, “Here, take
me, dye me heliotrope. Make an influential woman
of me”?</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener did not quail before the terrifying
outer wall of Mrs. Rust’s fortress. Believing as he
did that man makes himself, and that the pose of
victor is as easy to assume as any other, he was unaware
of the reality of the word ‘defeat.’ Whether
woman also makes herself, I never fully understood
from the gardener at this stage. But I gathered
that woman takes the rôles that man rejects.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener, as a protégé of Mr. Abel, who, on
the <em>Caribbeania</em>, was respected because he was not
personally known, found himself treated <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span></i> junior
officer, streaked with a certain flavour of second-class
passenger, but distinctly suggesting ship’s orchestra.
He was allowed to have his meals in the first-class
saloon, he was occasionally asked about the
weather by lady passengers, and the captain and
officers looked upon him good-naturedly, as a sort of
example of poetic licence.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed a good thing when dinner was over.
One had proved one’s courage, and the strain was
past. The suffragette, who had given a proof rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>of obstinacy than of courage, retired weakly to her
cabin. And the gardener stood on deck and looked
at the sea, while the moon followed the ship’s course
with her eyes. A table companion, an Anglican
priest, with a weak chin and piercing eyes, came and
leaned upon the rail at the gardener’s side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You smoke?” he asked, and you could hear that
he was very conventional, and that he believed that
he was not.</p>

<p class='c009'>A man-to-man sort of man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said the gardener, and added, “I have no
vices.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He said this sort of thing simply to exasperate.
The pose of indifference to the world’s opinion is apt,
sooner or later, to lead to the pose of wilful pricking
of the world’s good taste. The gardener had a
morbid craving for unpopularity; it was part of the
unique pose. Unpopularity is an excellent salve to
the conscience; it is delicious to be misunderstood.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest did not appear exasperated. He was
tolerant. The man who aims at unlimited tolerance,
as a rule, only achieves the absorbent and rather undecided
status of spiritual blotting-paper. But he is
a dreadfully difficult man to anger.</p>

<p class='c009'>I hate talking to people who are occupied in reminding
their conscience: “After all this is my sister,
albeit, a poor relation. I must be tolerant.”
Then they pray for strength, and turn to me, spiritually
renewed, with a brave patient smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the priest’s pose.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“You have no vices?” he said, in a slow earnest
voice. “How I envy you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener was more concerned with the varied
conversation of the sea. Each wave of it flung
back some magic unspeakable word over its shoulder
as it ran by. But he answered the priest:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t really envy me, you would rather be
yourself with virtues than me without vices.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest smiled the inscrutable smile of the
vague-minded. “You have a very original way of
talking. You interest me. Yerce, yerce. Tell me
what you were thinking about when I came up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener did so at once. Sometimes his imagination
weighed heavily upon his mind, and he
expanded, regardless of his listeners.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was thinking about the things I saw,” he said.
“Things that I often see before I have time to think.
Snapshots of things that even I have never actually
imagined. Do you know, wonders crash across my
eyes like a blow, when I am thinking of something
else. Ghosts out of my enormous past, I suppose.
There was a very white beach that I saw just now,
with opal-coloured waves running along it, and a
mist whitening the sky. There were very broad red
men in grey wolf-skins, standing in the water, dragging
dead bodies from the sea. There were little
children, blue and thin, lying dead upon the beach.
I know the way children’s ribs stand out when they
are dead. I have never seen a dead child, except
those....”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“You ought to write fiction, yerce, yerce,” said
the priest. “You have a very strong imagination.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have,” admitted the gardener. “But not
strong enough to control these visions that besiege
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest, who had preached more and known
less about visions than any one else I can think of,
was constrained to silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning the gardener found his garden.
He saw it under varied aspects and at varied angles,
for a gold and silver alternation of sun and shower
chequered the Atlantic, and inspired the <em>Caribbeania</em>
to a slow but undignified dance, like the activities of
a merry cow. The high waves came laughing down
from the high horizon, and curtseyed mockingly at
her feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a bay tree in a tub on either side of the
entrance to the garden, and the gardener, as he stood
between them, surveying his territory, slid involuntarily
from one to the other and back again, as the
world wallowed. The garden was conventionally
conceived, by a carpenter rather than a gardener.
Grass-green trellis-work, which should belong essentially
to the background, here usurped undue prominence.
Arches in the trellis-work, looking to the
sea, gave bizarre views, now of the heavy hurried
sky, now of the panting sea. Hanging drunkenly
from the apex of each arch was a chained wicker
basket, from which sea-sick <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">canariensis</span> waved weak
protesting hands. A few creepers, lacking sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>initiative for the task set before them, clawed
incompetently at the lowest rungs of the trellis. A
row of geraniums in pots shouted in loud brick-red
at the farther and more sheltered end of the garden.
It was impossible to tolerate the thought of Hilda
associating with those geraniums. She was a very
vulnerable and emotional soul, was Hilda. Deep
orange is a colour beyond the comprehension of the
vermilion and vulgar. A few sodden-looking deck-chairs
occupied the gardener’s territory, and repelled
advances. But on the farthest sat the suffragette.
She was crying.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you have ever crossed the Bay of Biscay while
weakened by emotion, you will not ask why she was
crying.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener dropped his pose between the bay
trees, and did something extraordinarily pretty, considering
the man he was. He sat on the next deck-chair
to hers, and patted her knee.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My fault&nbsp;...” he said. “My fault....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course he did not really believe that it was his
fault, but it was unusually gracious of him to tell the
lie.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette turned her face from him. She
had cried away all her vanity. Her hair was lamentable,
her small plain eyes were smaller than ever,
and her nose was the only pink thing in her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m very morbid,” she said. “And that at any
rate is not your fault.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t let’s think either about you or me,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>the gardener, and it would have been wise had he
meant it. “We have all our lives to do that in,
and it is a pity to do it in the Bay. When one’s feeling
weak, it’s easier to fight the world than to fight
oneself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette was a grey thing, a snake-soul.
To the eye of a grey soul there is something forbidding
about the many colours of the universe, and you
will always know snake-people by their defensive attitude.
It is an immensely lonely thing to be a snake,
to have that tortuous spirit, with no limbs for contact
with the earth. And yet the compensation is
most generous, for there are few joys like the joy of
knowing yourself alone.</p>

      <div class='line'>In cubes of blue, in curves of mauve,</div>
      <div class='line'>They spotted up my firmament;</div>
      <div class='line'>And with my sharp grey heart I strove</div>
      <div class='line'>To stab the colours as they went.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Lou-<em>la</em>&nbsp;...” they said—“Lou-<em>la</em>, a thing</div>

      <div class='line'>“Lou-<em>la</em>&nbsp;...” they cried—and now cry I—</div>
      <div class='line'>“At war without an enemy....”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t think how you dare to speak out your
imagination,” said the suffragette. “Most people
hide it like a sin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was always willing to be the text of his own
oratory.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Imagination is my Genesis, and my Book of
Revelations,” he answered. “There is nothing with
more power. It is stronger than faith, for it can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>really move mountains. It has moved mountains, it
has moved England from my path and left me this
clear sea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette walled herself more securely in.
“I have no imagination at all,” she lied, and then
she added some truth: “I am very unhappy and
lonely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The other day&nbsp;...” said the gardener, “you
were happy to be independent and alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s why I’m now unhappy to be independent
and alone. You can’t discover the heaven in a thing
without also tripping over the hell. I like a black
and white life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t think,” said the gardener suddenly, and
almost turned the patting of her knee into a slap.
“It’s a thing that should only be done in moderation.
Some day you won’t be able to control your craving
for thought, and then you’ll die of Delirium Tremens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not such a dangerous drug as some,” smiled
the suffragette. “I’d rather have that craving than
the drink craving, or the society craving, or the love
craving.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better to have nothing you can’t control.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You hypocrite! You can’t control your imagination.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re right,” said the gardener after a pause.
He was a curiously honest opponent in argument.
Besides, she had stopped crying, and there was no
special reason for continuing the discussion. Also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Mrs. Paul Rust at that moment appeared between
the bay trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Rust’s hair looked vicious in a garden, beside
the geraniums, which were at least sincere in colour,
however blatant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is this private?” she asked. There was something
in the shy look of the garden, and in the reproachful
look of the gardener, that made the question
natural.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said the gardener. “This is the ship’s
garden.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” said Mrs. Paul Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>She always said “good” to everything she had not
heard before. To her the newest was of necessity
the best. Originality was her ideal, and as unattainable
as most ideals are. For she was not in the least
original herself. She was doomed for ever to stand
outside the door of her temple. And “good” was
her tribute of recognition to those who had free
passes into the temple. It owned that they had
shown her something that she would never have
thought of for herself. For nothing had ever
sprung uniquely from her. Even in her son she
could only claim half the copyright.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette tried to rearrange her looks, which
certainly needed it. There are two sorts of women,
the women before whom you feel you must be tidy
and the women before whom such things don’t matter.
Mrs. Rust all her life had belonged to the former,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>all her life what charm she had, had lain in the
terror she inspired.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the first time the gardener questioned himself
as to his plan of attack. Hitherto he had pinned his
faith to inspiration. He had left the matter in the
hands of his private god, Chance. His methods
were very simple, as well as bizarre. His mind was
a tortuous path, but he followed it straightforwardly,
and never looked back. To do him justice, however,
I must say that he searched his repertoire for a suitable
point of conversational contact with Mrs. Rust.
Finding none, he dispensed with that luxury.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am the ship’s gardener,” he said, smiling at his
intended victim.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Rust was broad, and the deck-chair was narrow.
It was some time before a compromise between
these two facts could be arrived at, so the
remark came upon her at a moment of some stress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, then, what was that you were saying?”
she asked at last, in an unpromising voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener, who was very literal in very small
things, repeated his information, word for word,
and inflection for inflection. “I am the ship’s gardener.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Rust grunted. She showed no tolerance for
the thing that was not sensational. Nor had she
any discrimination in her search for the novelty.
Still, energy is something.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I am only ship’s gardener in theory,” persisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the gardener. “In practice I don’t even know
where the watering-can is kept.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you are here under false pretences,” retorted
Mrs. Rust a little more genially, for his last
remark was not everybody’s remark.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am,” said the gardener, suddenly catching a
fleeting perspective of the path to her good graces.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” said Mrs. Rust, and turned her little
bright eyes upon him.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she opened her eyes very wide, it meant that
she was on the track of what she sought. When she
shut them, as she often did, it meant that she did not
understand what was said. But it gave the fortunate
impression that she understood only too well.
She was instinctively ingenious at hiding her own
limitations.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the end of that interview, but a good beginning
to the campaign.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sea to some extent recovered its temper
within that day. Towards the evening, when slate
and silver clouds, with their backs to the <em>Caribbeania</em>,
were racing to be the first over the horizon,
the garden was invaded by passengers, racing to be
the first over the boundary of sea-sickness. The silence
of the unintroduced at first lay, like a pall,
along the deck-chairs, but a mutual friend was
quickly found in Mothersill, whose excellent invention
was represented in every work-bag. The bright
noise of women discussing suffering rippled along the
garden. Abuse of the <em>Caribbeania’s</em> stewardesses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>sprang from lip to lip. It was a pretty scene, and
the gardener turned his back on it, and went below
to water Hilda.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener’s cabin, which was impertinently
shared by a couple of inferior souls, was as square as
a box, and furnished with nautical economy. The
outlook from its porthole was as varied in character
as it was limited in size. At one moment one felt
oneself the drunken brain behind the round eye of a
giant, staring into green and white obscurity; at
another one blinked, as a mist of spray like shivered
opal spun up over one’s universe; again one enjoyed
an instantaneous glimpse of the flat chequered floor
of the Atlantic; and at rare intervals the curtain of
the sky slid over the porthole, and the setting sun
dropped across the eye like a rocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hilda sat wistfully on the recess of the porthole,
leaning her forehead against the glass. She had a
bud, chosen to match Courtesy’s hair. Just as
Hilda’s stalk was necessary to hold her bud upright,
so Courtesy herself was necessary to support the conflagration
of her hair on the level of the onlooker’s
eye. Both were necessities, and both were artistically
negligible.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener looked around the cabin. There is
something depressing about other people’s clothes.
There is something depressing in an incessant attack
on one’s skull by inanimate objects. There is something
depressing in a feeling of incurable drunkenness
unrelieved by the guilty gaiety that usually accompanies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>such a condition. There is something
depressing about ocean life below decks at any time.
The gardener and Hilda sat in despair upon the hardhearted
thing that sea-going optimists accept as a
bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I don’t want to go home,” the gardener
told himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hilda, poor golden thing of the soil, had no doubts
as to what she was suffering from. But the gardener
wondered why despair had seized him. Until he
remembered that the spirit of the sea walks on deck
alone, and is never permitted by the stewards to enter
the cabins. He climbed the companion-way, like a
tired angel returning to heaven after a stuffy day on
earth. He came upon Courtesy making a bad shot
at the door that leads to the Promenade deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come and sit in the garden,” he said in a refreshed
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>On deck, a few enterprising spirits were playing
deck quoits against the elements. The general
geniality whose rule only lasts for the first three days
of a voyage was reigning supreme. Young men
were making advances to young ladies with whom
they would certainly quarrel in forty-eight hours’
time, and young ladies were mocking behind their
hands at the young men they would be engaged to
before land was reached. The priest, with an appearance
of sugared condescension, was showering
missiles upon the Bullboard as though they were
blessings. (And they were misdirected.) The inevitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>gentleman who has crossed the Atlantic
thirty times and can play all known games with fatiguing
perfection, was straining like a greyhound on
the leash towards the quoits which mere amateurs
were usurping. Captain Walters, who has a twin
brother on every liner that ever sailed, was brightly
collecting signatures for a petition to the Captain
concerning a dance that very evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener, with unusual cordiality, gave the
reeling Courtesy his arm, as they threaded the maze
of amusements towards the garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was only one deck-chair unoccupied. It
was labelled loudly as belonging to some one else, but
Courtesy, always bold, even when physically weakest,
advanced straight upon it. It was next to the suffragette’s.
And the gardener became for the first time
aware of a cat in a bag, and of the fact that the cat
was about to emerge.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette was the sort of person next to
whom empty chairs are always to be found. She
had plenty to say, and what she said was often rather
amusing, but it was always a little too much to the
point, and the point was a little too sharp. She had
a certain amount of small talk, but no tiny talk. She
was not so much ignored as avoided. She had altogether
missed youth, and its glorious power of being
amused by what is not, correctly speaking, amusing.
Her generation thought her “brainy,” it was very
polite to her. Do you know the terrible sensation of
being invariably the last to be chosen at Nuts in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>May? This was the suffragette’s atmosphere. My
poor suffragette! It is so much more difficult to
bear the snub than the insult. Insult is like a
bludgeon thrown at the inflated balloon of our conceit.
With the very blunt force of it we rebound.
But the snub is a pin-prick, which lets our supporting
pride out, and leaves us numb and nothing. I always
feel the insult is founded on passion, while the
snub springs from innate dislike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I introduce Miss Courtesy Briggs&nbsp;...”
began the gardener, hoping for an inspiration before
the end of the sentence. “Miss Courtesy
Briggs....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Both women looked expectant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Courtesy Briggs&nbsp;... my wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Lor’!” said Courtesy, and then, with her
healthy regard for conventions, remembered that this
was not the proper retort to an introduction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you left Penny Street, a week ago&nbsp;...”
she said to the gardener, as she shook the suffragette’s
hand, “you didn’t tell me you were engaged.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wasn’t,” said the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy dropped the subject, because it was
hardly possible to continue it. She was not the girl
to do what was conventionally impossible. Besides
the bugle was sounding to show that dinner was
within hailing distance. Courtesy was a slave of
time. Her day was punctuated by the strokes of
clocks. Her life was a thing of pigeon-holes, and if
some of the pigeon-holes were empty they were all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>neatly labelled. She was the sort of person who
systematically allowed ten minutes every morning for
her prayers, and during that time, with the best intentions,
mused upon her knees about the little things of
yesterday. It is a bold woman that would squeeze
Heaven into a pigeon-hole.</p>

<p class='c009'>Theresa stopped in front of the gardener’s chair.
Theresa’s surname had been blown away from her
with the first Atlantic wind. So had the shining system
in her yellow hair. So had most of her land conventions.
She was not a thing of the ocean, but a
thing of the ocean liner. She had immediately become
Everybody’s Theresa. I could not say that
everybody loved Theresa, but I know that everybody
felt they ought to.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Captain said no dance this evening,” said
Theresa, in her telegraphic style. “Too much sea
on. Doctor said broken legs. But I went and
wheedled. Called the Captain Sweet William.
Dance at nine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The dance was at nine. There were no limits to
what Theresa could do—in her sphere.</p>

<p class='c009'>A proud quartermaster was superintending the last
touches of chalk upon the deck, when the gardener
and the suffragette led the exodus from the dining-saloon.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Paradise I hope I shall be allowed a furious
walk around a windy rocking deck at frequent intervals
throughout eternity. I know of nothing more
poetic, and yet more brilliantly prosaic. At such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>moments you can feel the muscles of life trembling
by reason of sheer strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette and the gardener walked so fast
that the smoke from the suffragette’s cigarette lay
out along the wind like the smoke behind a railway
train. The strong swing of the sea threw their feet
along. There was a moon in the sky and phosphorus
in the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there are people who go down to the sea in
ships, and yet confine their world to the promenade-deck.
The heart of Theresa’s world, for instance,
was the shining parallelogram, silvered with chalk,
on the sheltered side of the deck. Theresa, looking
extremely pretty, was superintending the over-filling
of her already full programme.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mustn’t walk round like that,” she said in the
polite tones that The Generation always used to the
suffragette. “Must find partners, because the orchestra
will soon begin to orch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are not dancing,” said the gardener. One
always took for granted that the suffragette was not
dancing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you will dance,” said Theresa, “I will give
you number eight.” She assumed with such confidence
that this was an inducement, that somehow it
became one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you very much,” replied the gardener.
“I’ll ask Courtesy Briggs for one, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette sat down upon an isolated chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I have a dance?” asked the gardener of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Courtesy. “I can’t dart or stagger, only revolve.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was sea-sick only three hours ago,” retorted
Courtesy with simplicity. “But I have a lot to talk
to you about, so you can have number one. And
we’ll begin it now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the orchestra was still idling in the melancholy
manner peculiar to orchestras. Why—by the way—is
there something so unutterably sad in the expression
of an orchestra about to play a jovial onestep?</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do want to know about your marriage,” pursued
Courtesy, whose curiosity was a daylight trait,
like the rest of her characteristics. “When did it
happen, and where did you meet her, and why did
you have a wedding without me to help?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I met her—on the way to Paradise,” said the
gardener, posing luxuriously as an enigma. “We
got married on the way too. It was a no-flowers-by-request
sort of wedding, otherwise we would have
invited you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I can’t understand it,” said Courtesy.
“Only a week ago you were snivelling over a broken
boot-lace.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener’s pose had a fall. He might have
expected that Courtesy would trip it up.</p>

<p class='c009'>The violins, relieving their feelings by a preliminary
concerted yell, settled down to a lamentation in
ragtime.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener danced rather well, as his mother
had taught him to dance. Courtesy danced rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>well, after the manner of The Generation. But the
<em>Caribbeania</em> danced better than either. She reduced
them to planting their four feet wide and sliding up
and down. The ship’s officers, with their lucky partners,
leaning to the undulations of the deck, like willows
bending to the wind, showed to immense advantage.
They evidently knew every wave of the
Atlantic by heart. But among the remaining
dancers there was much unrest. Captain Walters,
who was accustomed to be one of the principal ornaments
of a more stationary ballroom, at once
knocked his partner down and sat upon her.
Theresa and a subaltern slid helplessly at the mercy
of the elements into a forest of chaperons. The
gardener and Courtesy leaned together and clung,
with a tense look on their faces.</p>

<p class='c009'>I dare not say what angle the deck had reached
when the orchestra, with an unpremeditated lapse
into a Futurist style of melody, broke loose, and
glided in a heaving phalanx to join the turmoil.
The piano, being lashed to its post, remained a triumphant
survivor, calmly surveying the fallen estate
of the less stable instruments.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not enjoying myself a bit,” said Courtesy,
as she disentangled a violin from her hair, and
strove to dislodge the ’celloist from his position on
her lap. The gardener disliked agreeing with any
one, but he seemed by no means anxious to continue
dancing. The orchestra also seemed a little loth to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>risk its dignity again at once, and even Theresa,
though still plastered with a pink smile, was retiring
on the arm of her subaltern to a twilit deck-chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the distance, among her rows of empty chairs,
the suffragette was smiling. She had watched the
dancing with that half-ashamed sort of amusement
which some of us feel when we see others making
fools of themselves. And because she smiled, the
priest came and sat beside her. He considered himself
a temporary shepherd in charge of this maritime
flock, and you could see in his eye the craving for
souls to save. He had hardly noticed the suffragette
until her smile caught his eye, but directly he did
notice her he saw that she was not among the saved.
He therefore approached her with the smile he reserved
for the wicked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very amusing, is it not?” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the suffragette liked to see the young busy
with their youth, but because she was a snake she
could not bear to say so. Especially in answer to
“Very amusing, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>So she said, “Is it?” and immediately cursed herself
for the inhuman remark. Some people’s humanity
takes this tardy form of hidden self-reproach
after expression, and then it strikes inward, like
measles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, that’s as it may be, yerce, yerce,” said the
priest, who was so tolerant that he had no opinions of
his own, and had hardly ever been guilty of contradiction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“That is your husband, is it not?” he
added, as the gardener extricated himself from the
knot of fallen dancers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette actually hesitated, and then she
said, “Yes,” and narrowly escaped adding, “More
or less.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A most interesting young man,” said the priest,
who, with the keen eye of the saver of souls, had noticed
the hesitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Naturally he interests me,” said the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is so original,” continued the priest. “Even
his occupation strikes one as original. A gardener
on an ocean liner. The march of science, yerce,
yerce. Most quaint. I suppose you also are interested
in Nature. I always think the care of flowers
is an eminently suitable occupation for ladies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps,” she admitted. “But I am not a lady.
I am a militant suffragette.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest’s smile changed from the saintly to the
roguish. “Have you any bombs or hatchets concealed
about you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I had,” she replied. I fully admit that
her manners were not her strong point. But the
priest persisted. He noted the absence of any
answering roguishness, and recorded the fact that she
had no sense of humour. True to his plastic nature,
however, he said, “Of course I am only too well
aware of the justice of many of women’s demands,
yerce, yerce. But you, my dear young lady, you are
as yet on the threshold of life; it is written plain upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>your face that you have not yet come into contact
with the realities of life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In that case it’s a misprint,” said the suffragette.
“I am twenty-six.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Twenty-six,” repeated the priest. “I wonder
why you are bitter—at twenty-six?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I have taken some trouble not to be
sweet,” she said. “Because I was not born blind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As a matter of fact she had been born morally
short-sighted. She had never seen the distant delight
of the world at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest did not believe in anything approaching
metaphor. He considered himself to be too manly.
So he deflected the course of the conversation.
“And your husband. What are his views on the
Great Question?” (A slight relapse into roguishness
on the last two words.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have never asked him. I know he does not
believe in concrete arguments from women.
Though he approves of them from men.” She fingered
a bruise on her arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The arguments about women’s lack of physical
force are the most incontrovertible ones your cause
has to contend with,” said the priest. “Say what
you will, physical force is the basis of life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think it is a confession of weakness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is something in what you say,” said the
priest. He did not really think there was, for he
had taken no steps to investigate. He was busy
thinking that this was an odd wife who did not know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>her husband’s views on a question that obsessed her
own thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener had by now extracted Courtesy
from the tangle, and was steering her towards a
chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your husband appears to know that young lady
with the auburn hair,” said the priest. “He knew
her before he came on board, did he not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Apparently he did,” said the suffragette. “I
didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was providing him with so many clues that he
was fairly skimming along on the track of his prey.
When he left her he felt like a collector who has
found a promising specimen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Altogether on the wrong lines,” he told himself,
and added, “Poor lost lamb, how much she needs a
helping hand”; not because he felt sorry for her, but
because word-pity was the chief part of his stock-in-trade.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning the <em>Caribbeania</em> had flung the winds
and waves behind her, and had settled down to a
passionless career along a silver sea under a silver
sky,—like man, slipping out of the turmoil of youth
into the excellent anti-climax of middle life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Similes apart, however, the <em>Caribbeania</em> was now
so steady that an infant could have danced a jig upon
her deck. Several infants tried. Amusements
rushed upon her passengers from every side. A
week passed like a wink. Hardly were you awake
in the morning before you found yourself pursuing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>an egg round your own ankles with a teaspoon.
Sports and rumours of sports followed you even unto
your nightly bunk. Everybody developed talents
hitherto successfully concealed in napkins. Courtesy
found her life’s vocation in dropping potatoes into
buckets. She brought this homely pursuit to a very
subtle art, and felt that she had not lived in vain.
Not that she ever suffered from morbid illusions as
to her value. The gardener brought to light a latent
gift for sitting astride upon a spar while other men
tried with bolsters to remove him. The suffragette,
when nobody was looking, acquired proficiency in the
art of shuffling the board. When observed, she instinctively
donned an appearance of contempt. Mrs.
Paul Rust settled herself immovably in a chair and
applauded solo at the moments when others were not
applauding. The priest, looking in an opposite direction,
clapped when he heard other hands being
clapped, in order to show the kind interest he took in
mundane affairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>While occupied thus, one day, he found himself
next to Courtesy. That determined lady had her
back to a Whisky and Soda Race then in progress,
and looked aggrieved. She had been beaten in the
first heat, whereas she was convinced that victory had
been her due. Courtesy suffered from all the faults
that you and I—poetic souls—cannot love. She
was greedy. She was fat. She could not even lose
a race without suspecting the timekeeper of corruption.
All the same, there was something so entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>healthy and human about her, that nobody had ever
pointed out to her her lack of poetry, and of the
more subtle virtues.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest, who had also never been able to lose a
game without losing his temper too, sympathised
with Courtesy, and employed laborious tact in trying
to lead her thoughts elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Trinity Islands are your destination, are they
not, yerce, yerce?” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied Courtesy. “And I wish this old
tub would buck up and get there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have reasons of your own for being very
anxious to arrive?” suggested the priest archly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing special that I know of,” answered
Courtesy. “I’m only an ordinary globe-trotter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frankly, she was being sent out to get married.
But this, of course, was among the things that are
not said. Her father had become tired of supporting
a daughter as determined to study art in London
as she was incapable of succeeding at it. He had
accepted for her a casual invitation from a cousin
for a season in the Trinity Islands. The invitation
was so very casual that Courtesy had appreciated the
whole scheme as a matrimonial straw clutched at by
an over-daughtered parent. But her feelings were
not hurt. She had bluff, tough feelings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How curious that you should have found former
friends on board!” said the priest. “How small
the world is, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, isn’t it?” assented Courtesy, whose heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>always warmed towards familiar phrases. “And so
odd, too, him being married within the week like
this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest pricked up his ears so sharply that you
could almost hear them click. “So quickly as
that?” he encouraged her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, when he left the private hotel where he and
I were both staying just over a fortnight ago, he was
not even engaged. He says such quaint things about
it, too. He says he picked her up on the way to
Paradise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The mention of Paradise confirmed the priest’s
worst suspicions. But “Yerce, yerce....” was his
only reply to Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Late that night the priest walked round and round
the deck trying to peer into the face of his god, professional
duty. His conscience was as short-sighted
as some people’s eyes, and he was often known to
pursue a shadow under the impression that he was
pursuing his duty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I must warn the Captain,” he said.
“And that bright young lady who unconsciously gave
me the news. And Mrs. Rust, who encourages that
misguided young man to talk. And Mrs. Cyrus
Berry, who lets her children play with him. As for
the woman—I always think that women are the
most to blame in such cases.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Although he was altogether narrow his limits were
indefinite, except under great provocation. He
had not strength enough to draw the line anywhere.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Wicked” was too big a word for him; and although
he believed that the gardener and the suffragette
were in immediate danger of hell-fire, he could only
call them “misguided.” This applies to him only in
his capacity as a priest. In his own interests he was
very much more sensitive than he was in the interest
of his God.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes I think that angels, grown old, turn
into enemies to trap the unwary. The angel of tolerance
was the great saviour of history, but now he
saps the strength of every cause. Either I Am
Right, or I May Possibly Be Right. If I may only
possibly be right, why should I dream of burning at
the stake for such a very illusory proposition? But
if I am right, then my enemy is Wrong, and is in
danger of hell-fire. That is my theory. My practice
is to believe that belief is everything, and that I
may worship a Jove or a stone with advantage to my
soul. Belief is everything, and I believe. But if
my enemy believes in nothing, then I will condemn
him. Why should I be tolerant of what I am convinced
is wrong?</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest, in the dark, found some one clinging
round his knees. A woman—a little woman—wrapped
so tightly in a cloak that she looked like a
mummy. Her face was grey, and her lips looked
dark. Her hair lay dank and low upon her brow,
and yet seemed as if it should have been wildly on
end about her head. The whole of her looked horribly
restrained—bound with chains—and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>eyes, which should have given the key to the entreaty
which she embodied, were tightly shut. For five
seconds the priest tried to run away. But she held
him round the knees and cried, “Save me, save me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nobody had ever come to the priest with such a
preposterous request before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me go, my good woman,” he said, audibly
keeping his head. “Be calm, let me beg you to be
calm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She let him go. But she was not calm.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was very late, and the deck-chairs had been
folded up and stacked. As the woman would not
rise to the priest’s level, he saw nothing for it but
to sink to hers. They sat upon the deck side by side.
He felt that it was not dignified, but there was nobody
looking. And otherwise, he began to feel in
his element. Here was a soul literally shrieking to
be saved.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it? Tell me. You have sinned?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly not,” replied the woman in a hard thin
voice. “I have never deserved what I’ve got. It
seems to me that it’s God who has sinned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, be calm,” the priest jerked out. “Be
calm and tell me what has upset you so much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman began to laugh. Her laughter was
absurdly impossible, like frozen fire. It lasted for
some time, and the world seemed to wait on tiptoe
for it to stop. It was too much for the priest’s
nerves, and for his own sake he gripped her arm to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>make her stop. She was silent at once. The grip
had been what she needed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now tell me,” said the priest.</p>

<p class='c009'>She paused a little while, and seemed trying to
swallow her hysteria. When she spoke it was in a
sane, though trembling voice. “I am not Church of
England, sir, but you being a man of God, so to
speak, I thought&nbsp;... I am suffering—terribly.
There’s something gnawing at my breast&nbsp;... I’ve
prayed to God, sir; I’ve prayed until I’ve fainted
with the pain of kneeling upright. But he never
took no notice. I think he’s mistaken me for a
damned soul&nbsp;... before my time. Why, I could
see God smiling, I could, and the pain grew worse.
I’ve been a good woman in my time; I’ve done my
duty. But God smiled to see me hurt. So I prayed
to the Devil—I’d never have believed it three
months ago. I prayed for hell-fire rather than this.
The pain grew worse....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you seen the doctor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes. And he said the sea-voyage would do
me good. He couldn’t do nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor soul!” said the priest, and found to his
surprise that he was inadequate to the occasion.
“Poor soul, what can I say? It is, alas, woman’s
part to suffer in this world. Your reward is in
heaven. You must pin your faith still to the efficacy
of prayer. You cannot have prayed in the right
spirit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what a God—what a God&nbsp;...” shouted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>the woman with a wild cry. “To hide himself in a
maze—and me too distracted to find out the way.
Why, my tears ought to reach him, let alone my prayers.
I’ve sacrificed so much for him—and he gives
me over to this....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is terrible, yerce terrible,” said the priest.
“My poor creature, this is not the right spirit in
which to meet adversity. Put yourself in God’s
hands, like a little child....”</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman dragged herself suddenly a yard or
two from him. “Oh, you talker—you talker&nbsp;...”
she cried, and writhed upon the deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen,” said the priest in a commanding voice.
“Kneel with me now, and pray to God. When we
have prayed, I will take you to the doctor, and he will
give you something to make you sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t touch drugs,” said the woman. “And
I don’t hold with that young doctor in brass buttons.
If I pray now with you, will you promise that I shall
be better in the morning?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said the priest. It was spoken, not out
of his faith, but because that seemed the only way to
put an end to the scene. And when he prayed, in a
musical clerical voice, he prayed not out of his heart,
but out of his sense of what was fitting.</p>

<p class='c009'>The stars bent their wise eyes upon the wise sea
and bore witness that the priest’s prayer never
reached heaven’s gate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now you feel better, do you not?” he asked,
when he had said all that had occurred to him, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>intoned a loud Amen, as if to give the prayer an upward
impetus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” sobbed the woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are you? What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am Elizabeth Hammer, Mrs. Rust’s maid,”
she replied, and staggered in a lost way into the darkness
of the companion-way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-morrow it will be better,” the priest called
after her. And wished that he could think so.</p>

<p class='c009'>The world smiled next morning, when the sports
began again. Elizabeth Hammer was invisible,
probably concealed in some lowly place suitable to
her position. The sea was silver, the sky blazed
blue, the sun smiled from its height, like a father
beaming upon his irresponsible family. Mrs. Paul
Rust looked incredible in a pale dress, designed for
peculiarity rather than grace; pink roses sprigged it
so sparsely as to give the impression of birth-mark
afflictions rather than decorations. I am not sure
whether the feather in her hat was more like an explosion
or a palm tree. The gardener rolled upon a
deck-chair with three children using him as a switch-back
railway. Theresa was smiling from her top
curl down to her toes. Even the suffragette was
talking about the transmigration of souls to the
fourth officer. Everything on the surface was highly
satisfactory, and, on board ship, nothing except the
surface matters a bit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest had a leaky mind. He never poured
out all that was in it, but he could not help letting a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>certain proportion of its contents escape. He
paused in his daily walk of thirty times round the
deck, and found a seat beside Mrs. Paul Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your maid seems to be in a shocking state of
health,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She suffers from indigestion,” replied Mrs. Rust.
“Some fool of a doctor has told her that she has cancer.
She has quite lost her head over it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At any rate she appears to be in great pain,”
said the priest, who considered that indigestion was
rather too unclothed a word for ordinary use.
“And pain is a terrible thing, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Mrs. Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean that you consider it salubrious for the
soul?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Mrs. Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I wonder in what way you consider pain
desirable?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Rust, who had meant nothing beyond contradiction,
shut her eyes and looked immovably subtle.
The priest changed the subject. He had a real gift
for changing the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you made the acquaintance of that dark
young man who acts as the ship’s gardener?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An excellent young man,” said Mrs. Rust, immediately
divining that the priest did not approve of
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yerce, yerce, no doubt an excellent young man,”
agreed the priest mechanically. “But I have reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>to believe that his morals are not satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” said Mrs. Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think he is really married to that aggressive
young woman he calls his wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” said Mrs. Rust. She did not approve
of such irregularities any more than the priest did,
but she disapproved of disapprobation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest, being constitutionally incapable of argument,
and yet unable to broaden his view, was left
wordless. But an interruption mercifully rescued
him from the necessity of attempting a reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>Elizabeth Hammer, Mrs. Rust’s maid, appeared
at the companion door. Her eyes were fixed hungrily
upon the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a race about to be run, and the starter
stood ready to say the word. But Elizabeth Hammer
brushed past him and walked across the empty
strip of deck. She climbed the rail as though she
were walking upstairs, and dropped into the
sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hammer,” barked Mrs. Rust hoarsely, as she
heard the splash. That word broke the spell. A
woman shrieked, and Captain Walters shouted,
“Man Overboard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette was not a heroine. What she did
was undignified and unconscious. The heroine
should remove her coat, hand her watch to a friend,
send her love to a few relations, and bound gracefully
into the water. The suffragette, fully clothed,
tumbled upside down after Elizabeth Hammer. No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>noble impulse prompted her to do it. She did not
know of her intention until she found herself in the
water, and then she thought, “What a fool!” She
could not swim. The <em>Caribbeania</em> looked as distant
as heaven, and as high. She felt as if she had been
dead a long time since she saw it last. She paddled
with her feet and hands like a dog, her mouth was
full of water and of hair. She had never felt so
abased in her life, she seemed crushed like a wafer
into the sinking surface of the nether pit. For centuries
she wrestled with the sea, sometimes for years
and years on end a wave tore at her breath. She
never thought of Elizabeth Hammer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is absurd,” she thought, when eternity came
to an end, and she had time for consecutive thought.
She felt sure her eyes were straining out of their
sockets, and tried to remember whether she had ever
heard of any one going blind through drowning.
Then she cried, and remembered that her head must
be above water, if she could cry. She knew then
that there was some one on her side in the battle.
The sea seemed to hold her loosely now, instead of
clutching her throat. She had a moment to consider
the matter from the <em>Caribbeania</em>’s point of
view, and to realise what a pathetic accident had
occurred. It dawned upon her that her own hand,
wearing her mother’s wedding ring, was just in front
of her, holding the cord of a neat white life-buoy.
“Caribbeania” painted in black on the life-buoy
seemed like a wide mad smile.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“This is absurd,” bubbled the suffragette. “I
shall wake up in a minute now. It’s the air makes
one sleepy.” And then she thought of something
else for ages and ages, and could not find out what
she was thinking of, though she tried all the time.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the promenade deck of the <em>Caribbeania</em> the
gardener stood dumb with enormous astonishment.
His soul was dumb, his limbs were numb, his mental
circulation was stopped. He had a sort of impression
that the Atlantic had been suddenly sprinkled
with a shower of women, but he could only think of
one drop in the shower.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How red her face was as she went under—and
what a dear she is!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The <em>Caribbeania</em> had flung the two women behind
her, and swept upon her way, only for a second had
the red face of the suffragette floated like a cherry
upon the water beside the black wall of the ship.
The fourth officer had flung a life-buoy. Theresa
had fainted. There was a black cork-like thing a
thousand miles away which the fourth officer said
was the head of one of the women. The <em>Caribbeania</em>,
checked in her scornful attempt to proceed uncaring,
was being brought round in a circle. A boat
was being lowered.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a long silence on the promenade deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently—“Is it—her?” asked Courtesy in a
husky voice by the gardener’s side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” answered the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Elizabeth Hammer had found the sleep she sought
without recourse to drugs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everybody watched the distant boat receive the
thin small warrior out of the grasp of the sea, and
then sweep in wide circles on its search for Elizabeth
Hammer.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dream ended. The boat drew alongside.
The suffragette, who had to some extent collected
herself, made a characteristic attempt to step unassisted
from the boat. It failed. Everybody had
come down to the main deck to gratify their curiosity.
The suffragette was carried on deck, though she
obviously supposed she was walking. She looked
somehow out of proportion to the elements with
which she had battled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You poor lamb,” said Courtesy, looking very
dry and motherly beside her. “How do you feel?
I’m coming to help you into bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am perfectly well, thank you,” said the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why did you jump overboard if you couldn’t
swim?” asked the fourth officer, who was young and
believed that there are always reasons for everything.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was a mistake,” said the suffragette testily,
and was led below by Courtesy and a stewardess.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tongues were loosened. Everybody reascended
to the upper deck to vent their sympathy on Mrs.
Paul Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had remained in her chair, because she felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>that any other woman would have retired below
after witnessing the suicide of an indispensable part
of her travelling equipment. But she could not control
her complexion. Her face was blue-white like
chalk, beneath her incongruous hair. She would reply
to no questions, and the priest, after making several
attempts to create for himself a speaking part
in the drama, was obliged to abandon his intention
as far as she was concerned, for lack of support.
He turned to the gardener, whose stunned mind was
now regaining consciousness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do indeed congratulate you on the rescue of
your—your wife,” said the priest. “Yerce, yerce.
As for that other poor soul, I was afraid she might
make some attempt of the sort. She was suffering
from some internal complaint, and had lost control
of herself. Of course she had confided in me—yerce,
yerce. I was so fortunate as to be able to
say a few words of comfort. Perhaps it was a merciful
release. But I hope she was prepared at the
last. I hope that in that awful moment she thought
upon her sins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope so too,” said the gardener. “It is good
to die with a happy memory in the heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The general impression was that Elizabeth Hammer
had made a mistake, poor thing. She was the
subject of much conversation but little conjecture.
The big problem of her little mind was not so much
buried as never unearthed. She had made a mistake,
poor thing. That was her epitaph.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The suffragette was of course a heroine. She was
a heroine for the same reason as Elizabeth Hammer
was a poor thing—because nobody had analysed her
motives. It would have been heresy to suggest that
the heroine’s motive had been pure hysteria. She
had done a very useless thing in a very clumsy way,
but because it had been dangerous she was promoted
to the rank of heroine.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been a damn fool,” mourned the suffragette,
writhing profanely on her bunk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense,” said Courtesy briskly. “You have
been frightfully brave. It was only hard luck that
you couldn’t save the woman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I didn’t try. I had forgotten all about her
until this moment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense,” repeated Courtesy, busy with a hot-water
bottle. “You were splendid. We didn’t
know you had it in you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette laughed her secret laugh, which
she kept hidden beneath her militant exterior. The
sort of laughter that flies, not unsuitably, in the very
face of tragedy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a change,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be respected.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear gal, we all respected you all along.
Personally I always told them: ‘Mark my words,’
I said, ‘that gal’s got brains.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I expect they needed to be told.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense,” said Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“For the last five years,” said the suffragette,
“I have followed my conscience over rough land.
I have been suffragetting industriously all that time.
And every one laughed behind their hands at me.
Not that I care. But to-day I have been a fool, and
they have promoted me to the rank of heroine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense,” said Courtesy. “You’re not a fool.
And surely you never were a suffragette.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am a militant suffragette,” said the suffragette
proudly. “It takes a little courage and no hysteria
to march through the city with drunk medical
students waiting to knock you down at the next corner;
and it takes hysteria and no courage to fall by
mistake into the Atlantic.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You quaint dear,” said Courtesy, who had not
been giving undivided attention to her patient’s remarks.
“I do believe you’ve got something in you
besides brains after all. There now, you must try
and sleep. Pleasant dreams. And if you’re a good
gal and wake up with some roses in your cheeks,
you shall have your husband to come and have tea
with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said the suffragette. “Don’t call him
that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy wrenched the stopper of the hot-water
bottle tightly on, as though she were also corking up
her curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>As she went upstairs Courtesy discovered that she
quite liked the suffragette—from a height. For a
person suffering from brains, and from a mystery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and from political fervour, and from lack of physical
stamina, the woman was quite surprisingly likeable.</p>

<p class='c009'>On deck, Courtesy’s friendly feeling was immediately
put to the test. Mrs. Paul Rust beckoned
her to her side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That woman who jumped into the water after
Hammer&nbsp;... she is quite well again, of course?”
It was rather difficult for Mrs. Rust to put this question,
because the most obvious form was, “How is
she?” and that would have been far too human.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll be all right,” said Courtesy. “And even
if she wasn’t she wouldn’t say so. She keeps herself
to herself. You’ve torn a button off your coat.
Shall I sew it on for you? You’ll miss your maid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall not,” said Mrs. Rust. “She was a fool
to behave in that way. Nothing but indigestion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shouldn’t speak hardly of the dead,” said
Courtesy, indomitably conventional.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stuff and nonsense,” retorted Mrs. Rust, and
closed her eyes in order to close the subject. “That
young woman...”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall call her the suffragette,” said Courtesy.
“She says she is one, and she looks like one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At any rate, the priest tells me she is not married
to the ship’s gardener. Is that so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not the priest’s business. Nor mine either.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You would drop her like a red-hot coal if she
were not married.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Time enough to decide that later. I don’t approve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>of irregularity, of course. Marriage after all
is an excellent idea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That turned the balance successfully in the suffragette’s
favour. “You are wrong,” said Mrs. Rust.
“Marriage is an idiotic institution. It must have
been invented by a man, I feel sure. It is like using
ropes where only a silken thread is necessary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Lor’,” said Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Paul Rust decided to reach the truth by interrogating
the gardener. She always tried to approach
a mystery by the high-road, rightly considering
that the high-road is the most untrodden way in
these tortuous days.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come here,” she called to the gardener, when
Courtesy disappeared to see if her patient was
asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that young woman who foolishly jumped into
the sea—your wife?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener had resisted hours of siege on the
subject. He was tired. Besides he instinctively understood
Mrs. Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In some ways she is,” he replied, after rather
a blank pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” said Mrs. Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that young man who owns a little red hotel
in the woods in Hampshire your son?” asked the
gardener, suddenly face to face with an opportunity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In some ways he is,” replied Mrs. Rust inevitably,
without a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener became more and more inspired.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“Because if you are his mother, I am his friend, and
you may be interested to know that I put your point
of view clearly before him when I met him last. He
told me that you were unwilling to treat his hotel
as an investment, and I said, ‘Why should she?’
I said, ‘You may take it from me that she won’t.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you had no business to take my intentions
for granted,” retorted Mrs. Rust. “What the
dickens did you mean by it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told him&nbsp;...” continued the gardener, almost
suffocating in the grasp of his own cleverness, “that
obviously you could take no notice of so vague a
scheme. Ninety-nine women out of a hundred, I
said, would do as you were doing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You had better have minded your own business,”
interrupted Mrs. Rust wrathfully. “And you had
better mind it now. I shall do exactly what I like
with my money, no matter what the other ninety-nine
women would do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was afraid you would be annoyed by my speaking
like this,” said the gardener humbly. “It is
only natural.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stuff and nonsense. Do you know that the
priest is shocked by his suspicions about you and
your suffragette?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t mind,” said the gardener. “Being a
priest, I suppose he is paid to be shocked sometimes.
I don’t object to being his butt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” said Mrs. Rust. “Then you don’t continue
to assert that she is your wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“I can’t be bothered to continue to assert it,” said
the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” said Mrs. Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener felt that the reward of the successfully
unscrupulous rogue was within his reach. Lying
in a good cause is a lovely exercise. The warm
feeling of duty begun surged over him. He had
justified his presence on board the <em>Caribbeania</em>, he
had been true to Samuel Rust. The suffragette was
not drowned. The blue sea was all round him.
There was little else to be desired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shan’t be an unscrupulous rogue a moment
longer than I can help,” thought the gardener. “I
shall pose as being good next. We will be married
on landing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy at that moment returned and said,
“Your wife would like you to come and have tea
with her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t leave us alone,” begged the gardener of
Courtesy as they went below. “I don’t know how
to behave to heroines.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was obviously at a loss when he reached the
suffragette’s cabin. He had never seen her with
her hair down, and that upset him from the start.
He shook her gently but repeatedly by the hand,
and smiled his well-meaning young smile. He did
not know what to say, and this was usually a branch
of knowledge at which he was proficient.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you know that Captain Walters won the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>sweep yesterday on the Captain’s number?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be a donkey,” said Courtesy. There was
a genial lack of sting about Courtesy’s discourtesies,
which kept her charm intact through all vicissitudes.
“She doesn’t want to hear about the sweep. Let
her be just now. She’s busy pouring out your tea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For in the same spirit as the nurse allows a convalescent
child to pour out tea from its own teapot,
Courtesy had encouraged the suffragette to officiate.
The headquarters of the meal, on a tray, were balanced
upon the invalid’s bunk. It was not a treat
to the suffragette, who loathed all the details of
Woman’s Sphere, but for once she did not proclaim
the ungracious truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry,” she said nervously. “It’s years
since I did anything of this sort. But I don’t know
whether you take milk and sugar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener distrustfully eyed the hot water with
vague aspirations towards tea-dom that dripped into
his cup.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t take either milk or sugar, thank you,”
he said, “I like my troubles singly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Naughty boy,” said Courtesy, helping herself
generously to cake. “You are beastly rude. And
you’re a naughty gal, too, you suffragette. You
ought to know how your husband likes his tea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he’s not my husband,” said the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener sat with a bun arrested half-way to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>his mouth. He had lived a self-contained existence,
and had never before had a pose of his dismantled
by an alien hand. The experience was most novel.
He liked the suffragette more and more because she
was unexpected.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense,” said Courtesy. “You’re feverish.
You’ll tell me what you’ll be sorry for, in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s true; and I’m far from sorry for it,” said
the suffragette. “It’s almost too good to be true,
but it is. I’m still alone. But because he thought
I was a menace to England’s safety, he brought me
away—by force.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perfectly true,” corroborated the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You babies,” said Courtesy. “It’s lucky for
you it’s only me to hear you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not a secret,” said the gardener. “I’ve just
been talking about it to Mrs. Rust.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what did she say?” asked Courtesy and
the suffragette together.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She said, ‘Good.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>At that moment the voice of Mrs. Rust was heard
in the passage outside. “Miss Briggs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy ran clumsily from the cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That button,” said Mrs. Rust. “You said you
would.... Myself I never can remember which
finger I ought to wear my thimble on, or at what
angle the needle should be held....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Anybody else, arrived within three feet of the
suffragette’s door, would have thrown a smile round
the corner. But Mrs. Rust did not. She did possess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>a heart, I am told, but a heart is such a hackneyed
thing that she concealed it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you intend to do when you get to Trinity
Islands?” asked the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know what we shall do,” replied the
gardener. “I hate knowing about the future. I
am leaving it—not to fate, but to my future self.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you believe in fate?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. I believe in myself. I believe I can do
exactly what I like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what about me? Can’t I do exactly what
I like? Do you think you can do exactly what you
like with me?” asked the suffragette militantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So far I seem to have succeeded even in that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a pause he said suddenly, “I am a brute to
you, you dear, unaccommodating little thing. Somehow
my will and my deed have got disconnected in
my dealings with you. It is curious that having such
good intentions I should still remain the villain of
the piece. Yet I meant—if ever I had a woman—to
make up to her for all I have seen my mother go
through.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you have a woman—perhaps you
will&nbsp;...” said the suffragette. “You must wait
and see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come up and see land,” shouted Courtesy,
running in with a semi-buttoned coat in her
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener shot up the companion-way, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>behold, the gods had touched the sea, and fairyland
had uprisen.</p>

<p class='c009'>A long vivid island, afire in the ardent sun. Its
mountain was golden and eccentric in outline, its
little town and fortresses had obviously been built
by a neat-fingered baby-god out of its box of bricks.
The tiny houses had green shutters and red roofs.
There was no doubt that the whole thing had only
been created a minute or two before, it was so neat
and so unsullied. It was nonsense to call the place
by the name of a common liqueur, as the quartermaster
did, any one could see it was too sudden and
too faery to have a name or to make a liqueur.
There was something very exciting in the way it had
leapt out of a perfectly empty sea, and in the way
it sped over the horizon, as if shrinking from the
gaze of the proud <em>Caribbeania</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>It passed. The gardener had looked at a dream.
Courtesy had looked at good dry land. Captain
Walters had looked at the monastery from which
the liqueur emanated. Mrs. Rust had not looked at
all. It is surprising that there should be so much
difference in the material collected by such identical
instruments as one pair of human eyes and another.</p>

<p class='c009'>Islands are gregarious animals, they decorate the
ocean in conveys. The <em>Caribbeania</em>, her appetite
for speed checked, began to stalk them with bated
breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll be going through the Hair’s Breadth to-morrow
at seven,” said the Captain, in a fat, selfcongratulatory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>voice, as though he had himself created
the channel he referred to. “You must all get
up early to see her do it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There are few penances easier than early rising
on board ship. There are no inducements to stay
upon the implacable plane that is your bunk, in the
hot square cube that is your cabin. Your ear is
tickled by the sound of the activities of food in the
saloon outside; you can hear the sea singing in a
cheerful, beckoning way past your inadequate porthole.
You emerge from your cabin and find men
in pyjamas, and ladies in flowered dressing-gowns
and (if possible) thick pig-tails, or (if impossible)
pleasing head-erections of lace, sitting in rows at
sparkling tables, and being fed by stewards with
apples and sandwiches. There is scarcely ever any
need to remind the voyager by sea about the tiresome
superiority that distinguishes the ant.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain, therefore, had a large audience
ready for his sleight-of-nerve feat of threading the
Hair’s Breadth. He looked very self-conscious on
the bridge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Land climbed slowly down the spangled sloped sea
from the horizon. There seemed to be no gap in
the quivering line of it. Presently, however, as if
it had quivered itself to pieces, the line was shattered.
Silver channels appeared beckoning on every
side. The <em>Caribbeania</em>, blind except to her duty,
headed towards the least likely-looking channel of
all. The most ignorant passenger on the ship could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>have told the Captain that he was running into certain
destruction. Many longed to take command,
and to point out to the Captain his mistake. Like
a camel advancing foolhardily upon the needle’s eye
the <em>Caribbeania</em> approached. Her speed was slackened,
she went on tiptoe, so to speak, as if not to
awaken the gods of ill-chance, but there was nothing
faltering about her. She thrust her shoulders into
the opening.</p>

<p class='c009'>(It would be waste of time to inform me that in
nautical language a ship has no shoulders.)</p>

<p class='c009'>You could have whispered a confidence to the
palm trees on either side—except that you would
have been afraid to draw enough breath to do so,
for fear of deflecting the ship an inch from her
course.</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy was, as usual, bold. She spoke in quite
an ordinary voice. “Why, look, there’s a man
with hardly anything on, paddling! How killing!
He’s the colour of brown paper!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll soon be dead in Trinity Islands if you
find that killing,” snapped Mrs. Rust. “The Captain
evidently doesn’t know his business. We’re at
least six feet nearer to this shore than the other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The first of Trinity Islands heaved before them
quite abruptly when they had traversed the channel.
The land seemed to have been petrified in the act
of leaping up to meet them. I think the wind had
changed upon it at a moment of grotesque contortion.
My nurse used always to warn me that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>climatic change might fatally occur when my anatomical
experiments became more than usually daring.</p>

<p class='c009'>Green woods had veiled the harsh shapes of the
hills. Palms waved their spread hands upon the
sky-line. A tangle of green things tumbled to the
water’s edge. Far away to the right a faint blessing
of pearl-coloured smoke and a few diamonds flung
among the velvet slopes of the hills hinted at the
watching windows of Port of the West. Shipping
clustered confidentially together on either side of the
<em>Caribbeania</em>, like gossips commenting jealously on
the arrival of a princess of their kind. The entering
liner shook out little waves like messages to
alight on the calm shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole scene looked too heavy to be painted
on the delicate sea. It was absurd to think that that
pale opal floor should be trodden by the rusty tramp-steamers,
the tall red-and-black sailing ships, the
panting tugs, the blunt and bloated coal-tenders laden
with compressed niggerhood. There were broadheaded
catfish, and groping jellyfish in the water,
and they alone looked fashioned from and throughout
eternity for the tender element that framed
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette, who had risen from her berth,
contrary to the advice of Courtesy and of the doctor,
looked at the first of Trinity Islands with her soul
in her eyes and a compressed adoration in her breast.
For there was a silver sea, silver mist enclosing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>island, and a silver shore shining through the mist.
Silver, of course, is idealised grey—grey with the
memory of black and white refined away. Silver is
the halo of a snake-soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day was mapped out in so many ways by the
different passengers of the <em>Caribbeania</em>, that, from
their prophetic descriptions, you could hardly recognise
it as the same slice out of eternity. There were
globe-trotters, eager to trot this tiny section of the
globe in hired motor-cars, others anxious to buy
souvenirs in Port of the West all day, others nervously
determined to call upon the Governor in
search of a Vice-regal luncheon, others without imagination
desirous of fishing for catfish from the
poop, and a very few who dared to avow their intention
of spending the day in absorbing cold drinks on
the verandah of the King’s Garden Hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>In theory the gardener wished to lie upon a chair
on the shady side of the deck, with a handkerchief
over his face all day. Such a course would have
been flattering to his dignity and to his worship of
aloofness. In practice his unquenchable energy and
that of the suffragette were too much for him. He
was vividly stirred by the strange land. The clawlike
hands of the palms beckoned him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Following the suffragette, he bounded on to the
first launch as eagerly as though he were not a man
of theory. Behind him bounded Courtesy, and behind
her Mrs. Paul Rust strove to bound. Courtesy,
the gardener, and the suffragette sat squeezed in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>row upon a dirty seat in the launch. Mrs. Rust,
because sitting in a squeezed row was against her
principles, stood. By these means she kept many
men-passengers standing in wistful politeness during
the whole journey of three miles to the shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bay swept its wide arms farther and farther
round them. The palm trees on the promontories
on either side of the town looked no longer beckoning,
but grasping.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, isn’t it good!” said the gardener, thrilling
so that Courtesy and the suffragette, by reason
of compressed propinquity, had to thrill too. He
took the suffragette’s hand violently, and waggled it
to and fro. “Isn’t it fine&nbsp;...” and he jumped his
feet upon the deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You babies,” said Courtesy. For the suffragette,
even though she did not jump her feet, was
jumping her eyes, and obviously jumping the heart
in her breast. Most unorthodox for a snake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We shall run head foremost into the wharf,”
said Mrs. Rust in a final voice. “What a pity it
is that sailors never know their work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, isn’t it,” agreed the gardener, as if he had
been longing to say something of the sort. “Extraordinary.
Fine. Won’t it be fine if we run head
foremost into the wharf, and sink, to be sealed up
in this blue jewel here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He tried to pat the bay with his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Closed in the heart of it,” said the suffragette,
“like flies in amber.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“I shouldn’t like it at all,” sniffed Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not like flies in amber,” said the gardener.
“Because flies spoil the amber.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you and I wouldn’t exactly decorate the
sea,” remarked the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at those cannibals waiting for us,” said
Courtesy. “My dears, I’m simply terrified.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The cannibals received them from the launch with
the proverbial eagerness of cannibals. In the first
three minutes of their arrival on land the travellers
could have bought enough goods to furnish several
bazaars had they been so inclined. The suffragette,
by tickling the chin of a superb blue and yellow bird,
was considered to have tacitly concluded a bargain
with the owner as to the possession of it, and there
was much discussion before she was disembarrassed
of her unwelcome protégé. The gardener bought
two walking-sticks in the excitement of the moment,
before he remembered that he was devoid of money.
The owner of the walking-sticks, however, kindly
reminded him of the one-sidedness of the purchase,
and he was obliged to borrow from the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>The town, like a brazen beauty feigning modesty,
was withdrawn a little from the wharves. There
was a dry-looking grass space with goats as its only
gardeners. This the party crossed, and the sensitive
plant ducked and dived into its inner remoteness
as they passed. The streets in front of them,
hot and glaring, pointed to the hills, like fevered
fingers pointing to peace which is unattainable.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>The main street received them fiercely. The heat
was like the blaring of trumpets. The trams were
intolerably noisy, clanking, and rattling like a devil’s
cavalry charge. Black, shining women, with the
faces of bull-dogs—only not so sincere—swung
in a slow whirlwind of many petticoats up and down
the street, with vivid burdens of fruit piled in ochre-coloured
baskets on their heads. Little boys and
girls, with their clothes precariously slung on thin
brown shoulders, and well aired by an impromptu
system of ventilation, ran by the gardener’s side, and
reminded him of the necessity of quatties and half-pinnies,
even in this paradise of the poor, where
sustenance literally falls on your head from every
tree in the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is exhausting,” said Mrs. Paul Rust, forced
by extreme heat into a confession of the obvious.
“Policeman, where can we get a cab?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, please, missis,” replied the policeman, who
was tastefully dressed in white, by way of a contrast
to his complexion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense, man,” said Mrs. Rust. “I repeat,
where can a cab be found?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, please, missis,” replied the policeman,
acutely divining that his first answer had been found
wanting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You fool,” said Mrs. Rust, another unoriginal
comment wrung from her by the heat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The policeman understood this, and giggled bashfully
in a high falsetto.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“Missis wanta buggy?” asked a tobacconist, with
a slightly less dense complexion, from his shop door.
“Policeman nevah understand missis, he only a niggah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener, as ever prone to paint the lily, hurried
into the breach. “Ah yes, of course, we white
men, we always hang together, eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was The Moment of that tobacconist’s life.
The gardener all unawares had crossed in one lucky
stride those bitter channels that divide the brown
man from the black, the yellow man from the brown,
the white man from the yellow, and the buckra, the
man from England, from all the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>Three buggies suddenly materialised noisily out
of Mrs. Rust’s desire. They were all first upon the
scene, as far as one could judge from the turmoil of
conversation that immediately arose on the subject.
The gardener tried to look firm but unbiassed. The
three women stood and waited in a state of trance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun was working so hard at his daily task in
the sky, that one could almost have pitied him for
being called to such a flaming vocation in this flaming
weather.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally, Mrs. Rust awoke and, entering the nearest
buggy, shook it to its very core as she seated
herself and said, “King’s Garden Hotel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She could hardly have been recognised as the
Mrs. Rust of the <em>Caribbeania</em>. You could see her
pride oozing out in large drops upon her brow. Her
hat was on one side, and completely hid her sensational
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>hair, but for one flat wisp, like an interrogation
mark inverted, which reached damply to her eyebrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>The buggy horse, which consisted of a few promiscuous
bones, badly sewn up in a second-hand skin,
was more than willing to pause until the rest of the
party should be seated, and even then seemed desirous
of waiting on the chance of picking up yet
another fare. It was, however, reminded of its
duty by its driver, and turned its drooping nose in
the direction of the King’s Garden Hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they reached that heavenly verandah, they
felt for a moment as though they were suffering
from delusions. The <em>Caribbeania</em> seemed to have
arrived on shore bodily. A long vista of familiar
profiles rocked cheek by jowl, nose beyond nose, from
end to end of the verandah. There was Theresa,
who had made no secret of her intention of accompanying
Captain Walters “for a lark” on a visit
to a Trinity Island Picture Palace. There was the
priest, who had expressed a determination (which
nobody had tried to alter) to explore the famous
botanical gardens all by himself all day. There was
the fourth officer, who had left the <em>Caribbeania</em> inspired
by a vision of a long walk to a sandy beach
with a bathe at the end of it. There was the captain,
who had set out to buy his wife a stuffed alligator
as a silver-wedding present.</p>

<p class='c009'>That cool strip of green rocking-chairs had acted
on them all like a spider’s web, with the manager of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>the King’s Garden sitting in the middle of it, murmuring
cool things concerning drinks in an iced voice.
Exquisite white linen suits of clothes, the only blot
on whose spotlessness was the nigger inside them,
ambled up and down the line, like field-marshals reviewing
the household cavalry, armed humanely with
lemon squashes and whiskies and sodas.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener, Mrs. Rust, the suffragette, and
Courtesy enlisted in this force, and sat in a state of
torpor only partially dispelled by luncheon, until
Mrs. Rust began to look herself again. Her hat
straightened and elevated itself to its normal position,
and perched upon her hair like a nest of flowers
on a ripe hay-field. The curls dried up like parsley
after rain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Little by little the other tourists regained consciousness,
and with much show of energy set forth
to the nearest buggy stand.</p>

<p class='c009'>At about five, Courtesy, who was never happy unless
she was moving with the crowd, became restless.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s take a buggy and go back to the wharf,”
she suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will hire a four-wheeler and return to the
pier,” said Mrs. Rust in a contradictory voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Buggy or four-wheeler, there was only one sort of
vehicle to be found in Port of the West. They
manned the nearest conveyance and quibbled not over
its title.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would be frightful if we missed the boat,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>said Courtesy, who always said the thing that everybody
else had already thought of saying, but rejected.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the <em>Caribbeania</em> had begun raking the atmosphere
with hoarse calls for its dispersed passengers.</p>

<p class='c009'>But at the wharf the launch was still fussily collecting
the mails.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a flame-coloured azalea leaning gorgeously
out of the shade of the eaves of a customs
house. It was Courtesy’s colour—so obviously
hers that Courtesy herself unconsciously answered its
call.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ou—I say, that colour,” she said, and ceased,
because she could not voice the echo that streamed
from her heart to the azalea’s. It bent towards her
like a torch blown by the wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s autumn,” said the gardener. “And that
azalea is the only thing that knows it on the island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” commented Mrs. Rust. “All this
green greenhouse rubbish has no sense&nbsp;...” she
waved her hands to the palm trees that plaited their
fingers over the sky in the background.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Autumn, I think&nbsp;...” began the gardener, addressing
the azalea, “autumn runs into the year,
crying, ‘I’m on fire, I’m on fire&nbsp;...’ and yet glories
all the while; just as I might say, ‘This is passion,
this is passion&nbsp;...’ and so it is passion, and pain
as well, but I love it....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a funny thing to say!” said Courtesy.
“Do you say that sort of thing by mistake, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>quaint boy, or do you know what you’re talking
about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My lips say it by mistake,” said the gardener.
“But my heart knows it, especially when I see—a
thing like that. Otherwise, why should I have
become a gardener?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked round for the suffragette to see if she
had caught this spark out of his heart, and whether
the same torch had set her alight. She was not
there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come now, everybody,” said Courtesy. “The
launch’ll be starting in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the suffragette’s not here,” said the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was an instant’s blank as heavy as lead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stuff and nonsense,” said Mrs. Rust. “I can’t
wait here all day. If she wants to moon around and
miss the boat, let her. I am going.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She gave a hand each to two niggers, and sprang
like a detachable earthquake into the launch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I ought to wait,” said Courtesy. “She’s
a little shaky after yesterday, and you’re such an irresponsible
boy, gardener. She may have fainted,
while we were looking the other way. Or she may
be in that crowd buying souvenirs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener looked in the crowd for that well-known
round hat with the faded flowers. But he
knew that she would never buy a souvenir.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You jump in, gardener. I’ll wait,” said Courtesy.
“Perhaps there’ll be another launch.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“Lars’ launch, missis, please,” said one of the
mariners of the vessel in question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come at once, girl,” said Mrs. Rust’s harsh
voice from the stern.</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy wavered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Rust made a great effort. She became extremely
red. “Don’t you understand, girl, you
must come?” she shouted. “I can’t spare you....
I like you....” She cleared her throat and
changed her voice. “Can’t sew&nbsp;... buttons&nbsp;...
companion&nbsp;... large salary....”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the first part of the sentence reached Courtesy’s
sympathy. She jumped into the launch.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener stood on the hot wharf, and his
heart turned upside down. His plans were stripped
from him once more by this disgracefully militant
creature who had broken into his life. He hovered
on the brink of several thoughts at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The little fool. The dear little thing. The little
devil.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He ran round the customs house. He felt convinced
that it was interposing its broad person between
him and his suffragette. He could almost see
it dodging to hide her from his sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall find her in a minute,” he thought. “I’m
a lucky man.” He thought that his hopes were
pinned to the probability of arriving on the <em>Caribbeania</em>
in time.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the brown grass space there were only the
goats. The gardener was astonished not to see the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>fleeing form of a woman making for the town.
Things can be done very quickly if they must. The
gardener was at the corner of the main street before
he had time to think another thought. He looked
back, and saw in one fevered glance the launch only
just parting from the shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you seen a lady in white with a brown
hat?” he asked of a policeman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, please, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The conversation was from beginning to end above
the policeman’s head. But such a very hot buckra
man must be humoured. At random the policeman
pointed up the main street. The gardener was indeed
a man of luck, for that was the right direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>The main street on a fiery afternoon was as long
as eternity, but in certain states of mind a man may
bridge eternity in a breath, and not know what he
has crossed.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was on the race-course. He looked back and
the launch was approaching the <em>Caribbeania</em> in the
far-off bay, like a dwarf panting defiance at a giant.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he was half-way across the race-course, he
saw a white figure surmounted by a brown straw hat,
in the Botanical Gardens, in the shade of a banyan
tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette had lighted a cigarette in a laborious
attempt to appear calm, but she pressed her
hand to her breast as though she had been running.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“I’m not coming,” she shouted, when he was within
shouting distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>He vaulted the railing of the race-course, and the
railing of the garden. “What a bore!” he said.
“Then I must stop too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Very far off, the launch was nestling at the side
of the <em>Caribbeania</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For reasons I cannot be bothered to repeat to
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She veiled herself in a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know,” he added, “this is a repetition of
the Elizabeth Hammer episode. Pure hysteria.
Darling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was an appreciable pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, you’re right. So it is,” said the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on,” shouted the gardener. “We can
catch it yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I come,” she said, “it will be strong, not
weak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” said the gardener. “Come on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would be much easier to stay here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, much,” panted the gardener. “Come on,
come on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they ran, and on the way back they discovered
how interminable the main street was, and how relentless
is the sun of the West Atlantic. But when
they reached the wharf, the launch was still clinging
to the liner.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“A guinea,” shouted the suffragette, who was
experiencing the joys of very big-game hunting, “to
the boatman who can get us up to the <em>Caribbeania</em>
before she starts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She spoke in the voice of one accustomed to speaking
in Trafalgar Square, and everybody understood
her. A boat practically cut the feet from under
them before she had finished speaking, and in it they
splashed furiously out into the bay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We shall catch it,” said the gardener, rowing
energetically with one finger. “I’m a man of luck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was posing as one who would not utter a reproach.
It was a convenient pose for all concerned.
When they were about half-way, the suffragette said,
“You know—it takes a little courage to admit hysteria.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course it does, my dear,” said the gardener.
“I wouldn’t have done it for the world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently they were within bare shouting distance
of the whale which had threatened to make Jonahs
of them. A liner’s farewells are like those of a great
many women I know, very elastic indeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll do it,” shouted a voice from the high
boat-deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>They did it. The Captain shook his finger at
them from the bridge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What happened?” asked Courtesy, meeting
them on the main deck with a shawl to put round
the suffragette. Some women seem to think that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>shawl, or a hot bath, or a little drop of sal-volatile
are equal to any emergency under the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She didn’t know that was the last launch,” said
the gardener, still posing as the magnanimous defender.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I did,” said the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was buying a souvenir round the corner,”
persisted the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I wasn’t,” contradicted the lady. “I made
up my mind not to come back to the <em>Caribbeania</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ou, I say, how killing of you!” said Courtesy.
“But he changed your mind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. I overcame it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You quaint mite,” said Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener’s pose momentarily ended here, for
he was stricken with whirling of the head and sickness,
after running in the sun. Although there was
a touch of martyrdom about it, it was not a dignified
ending to a really effective pose. He had to seek the
comfort of Hilda in his cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hilda had three flowers now, and they had cost
her her independence, for she leaned upon a stick.
But among her round green leaves she held up
bravely her trinity of little gold suns.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener being thus removed, Courtesy and
the suffragette sat on the promenade-deck, and discussed
the day. The suffragette was astonished to
find herself in this position, being addressed as “my
dear,” by a contemporary. “Just like a real girl,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>she thought, for as she had never passed through the
mutual hair-brushing stage with other girls, she always
expected to be hated, and never to be loved.
She found it rather delightful to have Courtesy’s
hand passed through her arm, but she also found it
awkward, and hardly knew how to adjust her own
arm to the unaccustomed contact. The very small
details of intercourse are very hard indeed to a snake,
though pleasant by reason of novelty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you didn’t want to come back, and he bullied
you?” said Courtesy, frankly inquisitive. “After
all, my dear, that’s what women are for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is <span class='fss'>NOT</span>!” shouted the suffragette. “Women
are not born with a curse on them like that. I chose
to come back; I made a great effort, and came.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Lor’!” said Courtesy, and tactfully changed
the subject. Courtesy’s tact was always easily visible
to the naked eye. “My dear, I must tell you what
a killing interview I had with old Mrs. Rust. She
clutched my arm when I got into the launch—think
of that, my dear—and presently she said in a gruff
sort of frightened voice, as if she was confessing
a crime, ‘Miss Courtesy, I refuse to part with you;
you are what I have been looking for; you are not
to pay any attention to anybody else—do you hear?
I forbid it.’ I screamed with laughter—on the
quiet, you know. I said, ‘Do you want me to be a
substitute for Hammer, Mrs. Rust?’ ‘No,’ she
said. ‘Hammer was only a stopgap; I was keeping
the position open for a person like you. I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>give you two hundred a year if you will promise to
stay by me as long as you can bear me’—and then
she shouted as if she had made a mistake, and
thought that noise could cover it—‘I mean as long
as I can bear you.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So what did you answer?” asked the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, two hundred a year—what could I
say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what were you originally going out to Trinity
Island for?” asked the suffragette. “To visit
relatives, weren’t you? What will they say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, they won’t say anything—to two hundred
a year. I was really only coming out as a globe-trotter.
I loathe colonial relations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The matrimonial motive was the skeleton in Courtesy’s
cupboard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But wasn’t it killing, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very killing,” agreed the suffragette gravely.
She felt like one speaking a foreign tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then it occurred to Courtesy that she was
squeezing the arm of one who, after all, had a criminal
disregard of convention. She withdrew her
arm, and proceeded to try and storm that house
which she considered to be built on sand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I could understand what you are up to,
my dear?” she said. “Can’t I persuade you to
leave that naughty gardener, or to marry him? You
needn’t run away, or drown yourself or anything,
just say to him, ‘<span class='sc'>This won’t do.</span>’ I should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>frightfully glad if I could feel you were all right.
Why don’t you get married on landing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We don’t want to,” said the suffragette, who was
too inexperienced in the ways of The Generation to
feel offended. “We neither of us ever pretended
to want to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ou yes, of course I know the catchwords. I
know you just came together as friends, and didn’t
see any harm in it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we didn’t come as friends—we came as
enemies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Courtesy, with a furrowed brow.
“But really, my dear, enemies don’t do these things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They do. We do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my good girl, you must know—you can’t
be as innocent as all that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Scott, no!” said the suffragette. “I’m
not innocent!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then am I to conclude,” said Courtesy, suddenly
frigid, “that you fully realise the meaning of the
life you are leading?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are to conclude that,” said the suffragette,
in a voice of growing militancy. “I realise its
meaning much more fully than you do. I shall leave
the gardener directly it becomes convenient to me
to do so. For an utter stranger his behaviour has
certainly been insufferable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Lor’!” exclaimed Courtesy, falling back upon
her original line of defence. “An utter stranger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>... I must go and button Mrs. Rust into her evening
gown.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There is something very annoying to a woman in
being accused of innocence. The suffragette was
quite cross.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the next two days the <em>Caribbeania</em> threaded
her way cautiously between shore and shore. The
horizon was frilled with palm-embroidered lands.
Dry, terrible-looking beaches, backed by arid brown
hills, marred the soft character of those calm seas.
It was as if the <em>Caribbeania</em> saluted the coast of
South America, and South America turned her back
upon her visitor. At two or three ports in that forbidding
land the boat touched. Drake had passed
that way, and had left his ill-gotten halo upon the
coast, but that was the only life of the land. The
flat, dead towns seemed brooding over flat, dead
tragedies.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was almost a relief to the travellers when the
last night fell, and the ship was enclosed in darkness
and its trivial insularity. There was a great dance
that night. Captain Walters called it the Veterans’
dance, because the chalked deck was thick with non-combatants,
who had determined to cast care aside
and join with youth, because after all it was the last
night, and one would never meet any of these people
again. As a matter of fact, there was no youth to
be joined, for youth sat out and began its farewells.
Half a dozen hours is not an over-large allowance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>of time for farewells between people who have
known each other three throbbing ocean weeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette actually danced with the chief engineer.
He always danced with ladies who could
not find partners, being a conscientious young man of
forty-two, with a brand-new bride at home. The
suffragette knew well that by his courtesy she was
branded as one undesired, and she laughed her invisible
cynical laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>I think men are akin to sheep as well as to monkeys,
and the theory only needs a Darwin to trace
the connection. I have yet to meet the man who,
where women are concerned, does not follow in the
track of others of his kind. I think that very few
men conceive an original preference for a woman
unbiassed by the public tendency.</p>

<p class='c009'>Directly the gardener saw the suffragette dancing
with the chief engineer, he wondered why he was
not dancing with her himself, although she danced
rather badly. The gardener felt a mysterious call
to go and monopolise her directly she was at liberty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad you have come to talk to me,” said the
suffragette. “Because I shall go on shore early to-morrow,
and should like to say good-bye to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye?” questioned the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You didn’t really expect me to stay with you,
did you?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said the gardener, and thought how peaceful
and how stupid life would be without her. “I
shan’t dream of letting you go.” And even while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>he said it, he experienced the awful feeling of being
powerless to make his words good. He realised for
the first time how indispensable to a man’s sight are
soft straight hair that has never committed itself to
any real colour, and a small pointed face, and quick
questioning eyes. But there was something indescribable,
peculiar to the suffragette, that made it
impossible to humble oneself before her. She was
anything but a queen among women; no man had
ever wished to be trodden under her feet, though
they were small and pretty. Plain people often
have pretty hands and feet, a mark of Nature’s tardy
self-reproach.</p>

<p class='c009'>To any other woman, the gardener might have
said, “Please, my dear&nbsp;...” with excellent results.
He had a good voice with a tenor edge to it, and he
could pose very nicely as a supplicator. But not to
the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not brought you all this way just to let
you return to your militant courses,” he said, with a
sort of hollow firmness. “I owe a duty to Trinity
Island, after all, now that I have imported you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette smiled and said she was tired and
would go to bed—good-bye.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener said Good-night.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <em>Caribbeania</em> and the first ray of the sun
reached the Island simultaneously next morning.
When the gardener came on deck at half-past seven
he found himself confronted by the town of Union,
backed by its sudden hills. The <em>Caribbeania</em>, like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>robber’s victim, ignominiously bound to the pier, was
being relieved of its valuables. The air was thick
with talk. On the pier the over-dressed representatives
of British rule, in blue serge and gold braid,
rubbed shoulders with the under-dressed results of
their kind tyranny, in openwork shirts and three-quarters
of a pair of trousers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your wife went off early,” said the fourth officer
to the gardener. “I asked her whether she were
eloping all by herself, and she said you knew all
about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks,” said the gardener curtly.</p>

<p class='c009'>You will hardly believe me when I tell you that
his first conscious thought after this announcement
was that he had no money to tip the steward with.
The suffragette meant a good deal to him, and
among the things she meant was temporary financial
accommodation.</p>

<p class='c009'>I hope that you have noticed by now that he was
not a money-lover, but a steward was a steward, and
this particular steward had been kind in improvising
a crutch for Hilda. Any assistance from the suffragette
was, of course, taken as temporary: independence
was one of the gardener’s chronic poses. He
meant to change it from a rather hollow dream into
reality on arriving on the Island; he supposed that
he would be able to turn his brains into money. He
considered that no such brain could ever have landed
at Union Town. Its price in coin, which had been
rather at a discount in the stupid turmoil of London,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>would be instantly appreciable under this empty sky.
His pose on the Island was to be The One Who
Arrives, in capital letters.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went down to his cabin to pack his little luggage.
He had nothing beloved to pack now; men’s
clothes seem to be inhuman things without a touch
of the lovable, and they were all he had. For Hilda
was dead. For the last week of her life she had
been a little concrete exclamation of protest against
her unnatural surroundings. One born to look simply
at the sun, from the shelter of a whitewashed
cottage wall, with others of her like jostling beautifully
round her; a fantastic fate had willed that
she should reach the flower of her life in a tipsy
cabin, with a sea-wind singing outside the thick glass
against which she leant. The gardener had given
her a sailor’s grave somewhere near the spot in the
Spanish Main to which I hope the spirit of Drake
clings, for his mother-sea received him there. It
was hardly a suitable ending for Hilda, but it was
the best available.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener set himself to put his scanty property
together stealthily, and creep from the boat, that
the stewards might not see him go. He had an unposed
horror of ungenerosity. To him, as to most
men, the tip was more of a duty than the discharge
of a debt. He suffered keenly for a while from the
discovery that there was no escaping from the stewards
to-day, they were stationed with careful carelessness
at every corner. Presently the siege was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>raised unexpectedly by the arrival of the boot-boy
with a note.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The lady left it, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It contained a five-pound note, and it was addressed
in the suffragette’s small defiant handwriting.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course the hero of a novel should have thrown
the whole missive into the sea. He should have
struck an attitude and explained to the admiring
boot-boy that such gifts from a woman could only be
looked upon as an insult. But you must remember
the gardener considered that the fortunes of the
Island were at his feet. And he would not have
gone so far as to pose at his own expense—not to
speak of the steward’s. He put the note in his
pocket, and went to the purser for change.</p>

<p class='c009'>When his duties were discharged, he came on deck
to collect any plans that might be in the air. It is
a most annoying fact that theories will not take the
place of plans. In theory you may be The One Who
Arrives, but in practice you have to think about passing
the customs and finding a cheap hotel and getting
yourself a sun-helmet. I think the world has an
antipathy to heroes; it certainly makes things very
hard for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>On deck Courtesy was sitting calm and ready.
Her plans had been made for three days. She had
only just stopped short of writing a time-table for
the hourly career of herself and Mrs. Rust throughout
their sojourn on the island. She had a genius
for details.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“The suffragette has disappeared,” said the gardener.
A disarming frankness was one of his
weapons.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m jolly glad,” replied Courtesy. “I believe
you owe that to me, you naughty boy. I gave her
a bit of my mind about it the other day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener uttered no reproaches. He felt
none. For he had learnt by now that the suffragette
would never be affected by a bit of anybody’s
mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you going to do?” asked Courtesy.
“We are going to the St. Maurice Hotel for four
days—Father Christopher told us of it—and at
mid-day on Saturday we go up to the hills for a fortnight,
and then we hire a car and tour round the
Island, staying twenty-four hours at Alligator Bay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to look for work,” said the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sugar or bananas?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither. Head-work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stuff and nonsense,” said Mrs. Rust. “Nobody
on the Island ever uses their head except to carry
luggage on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s why I shall find work. There’s no competition
in my line.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You funny&nbsp;...” giggled Courtesy. “Isn’t he
quaint, Father Christopher?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For the priest was passing on his twenty-second
circuit of the deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very droll, no doubt,” said the priest in the
voice of a refrigerator, and continued to pass. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>was very much annoyed with the gardener’s soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener waited till he came round again before
saying to Courtesy, “Besides, I have to look
for the suffragette.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope you won’t find her this time,” said Courtesy.
“Will you come to tea with us one day, and
tell us which of your searches seems most hopeful.
You see, now the suffragette’s gone, you are respectable
for the moment, and I needn’t be afraid for
Mrs. Rust’s morals.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Courtesy giggled, her hair laughed in the
most extraordinary way. Everything she did was
transmuted into something wonderful by that halo
of hers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll come to-day, if I may,” said the gardener,
who had never mastered the art of social diffidence.
“You’d better have me to-day, for I hope I shan’t
be respectable to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy did not want him to-day. In her code
there was only one programme for the first day in
a strange land. It was made up of a visit to the
principal church, the principal shop, the principal
public gardens, and to a few “old-world relics of the
past.” It did not include ordinary five-o’clock tea
with a familiar figure. But, on the other hand, her
invincible conventionality made it impossible for her
to evade the gardener’s suggestion. Courtesy was
content to suffer for her convictions. At any rate,
you will notice that Mrs. Rust was not consulted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may come,” Courtesy said. “At five.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>We are due back from the cathedral at a quarter
to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Probably the reason why Mrs. Rust submitted to
Courtesy’s tyranny from the first was that no other
woman in the world would have done so.</p>

<p class='c009'>The land reeled under the gardener’s feet as he
arrived. The only comfort in parting with the sea
after a long intimacy is that for the first day or two
the land follows the example of its sister element.
The gardener found more difficulty in walking
straight along Union High Street than he had experienced
along the deck of the <em>Caribbeania</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The morning was yet very young when he put his
little luggage down at the bamboo-tree arch of a
house that proclaimed itself ready to receive boarders
at moderate terms. He relied much on impulse,
and the little house, which was lightly built on its
own first story, so to speak, beckoned to him. But
only in theory, for when he mounted the flight of
wooden steps, and, through the open door, saw the
dirty living-room, seething with gaudy trifles, he
knew that in practice it was better suited to his means
than to his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, he had rung the bell. One has to pay
penalties for acting on impulse. A woman with
black wire hair, a face the colour of varnished deal,
and a pale pink dressing-gown, appeared. Luckily
she transpired to be the hostess before the gardener
had voiced the fact that he mistook her for a drunken
housemaid.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“I want a room here,” began the gardener, who
had never wanted anything less in his life. But the
three pounds lay very light in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can give you one,” said the lady, and took
his portmanteau. She could have given him several,
but not one worth having. She conducted him
through one or two doors that led from the living-room.
Each showed a less attractive bedroom than
the one before, but the cheapest was barely within
the range of prudence, as far as the gardener’s pocket
was concerned. In a leaden voice, proceeding from
a heart of lead, he concluded a bargain for the temporary
possession of the least inviting. And when
it was done, and the portmanteau deposited drearily
in the middle of a dirty linoleum floor, he discovered
that time had been standing still, and that it was
hardly nearer five o’clock than before.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the first time he had realised the four thousand
miles that lay between him and the kindly grey
pavements of Penny Street. He remembered the
look of the London lamps reflected in the slaty mirrors
of London streets&nbsp;... the smile of the ridiculous
little griffin who sits on a pedestal at the top
of Fleet Street, playing the ’cello with his shield&nbsp;...
the shrugging shoulders of St. Paul’s on tiptoe
on the peak of Ludgate Hill&nbsp;... the dead
leaves blowing down the Broad Walk, in the
rain....</p>

<p class='c009'>There is no pose that saves you from that awful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>longing for the things that are no longer yours, and
which you hated while you possessed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I said I was enough for myself. And I am not,”
said the gardener, and hid his face in the mosquito
net.</p>

<p class='c009'>Strange things in barbaric colours made the garden
outside a whirlpool. Sometimes these things say
to you: “You are a very long way from home”;
and you exult, and think This is Life. But sometimes
they say again: “You are a very long way
from home”; and you cry out, and think This is
Worse than Death.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now there are moral drawbacks about the posing
habit. But there are also advantages, though possibly
none deserved. For after three minutes of
despair the gardener straightened himself, blinked,
and began putting his spare shirt into a drawer that
would not shut. He was posing as One Who was
Seeing Life, and who was Making the Best of it.
The vision that inspired this brave pose was the
ghost of a pair of small haggard eyes, set in a short
pointed face, eyes that cried easily and never surrendered.
A thin unbeautiful ghost with clenched
fists, and in the air, the ghost of a low and militant
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not enough,” the gardener admitted.
“But together, we are enough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He whistled a comic song tentatively. The Englishman
never whistles or sings to suit his feelings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>He dies to the tune of “Tipperary,” or goes to his
wedding humming the “Dead March in Saul.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no more life to be seen in that hot
little room, even by one fixed in an optimistic pose.
He emerged into the sitting-room, and through an
opposite and open door he could see the pink dressing-gown,
containing his landlady, heaving sleepily
under a mosquito net. One of her bare feet was
drooping under the net. At this he had to swallow
down London again violently, and remember that he
was Seeing Life, and that he was Luckier than Most.</p>

<p class='c009'>Did you know that the surest way of ensuring luck
is to be sure that you are lucky?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I will find my suffragette,” he said, standing
between the bamboos at the gate. And he expelled
an entering misgiving that he was perhaps presuming
on his luck.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was curiously cool in the shade of the high
cactus hedge that ran along one side of the way.
A fresh breeze, like the unbidden guest at the wedding,
conscious that it was not attired in character,
crept guiltily in from the sea. The sun, which
would have disclaimed even distant relationship with
the cool copper halfpenny that inhabits English skies,
fretted out the black shadows across and across the
white street. The gardener thought painfully of
many glasses of cold water that he had criminally
wasted in England. He stiffened his long upper lip,
and tried to look for new worlds instead of remembering
the old.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>He went into the Botanical Gardens, and sat on
a seat opposite the mad orchids. I think the Almighty
was a little tired of His excellent system by
the time He came to the orchids, so He allowed
them to fashion themselves. For they are contrived,
I think, and not spontaneously created like the rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the other end of the seat were two children,
so blessedly English that for a moment the gardener
smelt Kensington Gardens. The girl wore very little
between her soft neck and her long brown arms
and legs, except a white frill or two, and a passion
flower in her sash. The boy, more modest, was encased
in a white sailor suit. Both were finished
off at the feet with sandals.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hardly had the gardener sat down when he was
regretfully aware that he had sat by mistake on a
pirate-ship in mid-ocean. The two commanders
looked coldly at him from their end of the treasure-laden
deck, and there was an awkward silence which
somehow left the impression that much exciting talk
had immediately preceded it on that vessel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg your pardon,” said the gardener. “I
forgot to tell you that I am the prisoner you seized
when you captured your last prize. There was a
desperate resistance, but in spite of heavy odds, you
overcame me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy, because he was a boy, looked for a second
towards his mahogany-coloured Nana, who was
staring an orchid out of countenance farther up the
path. The girl, because she was a girl, looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>neither right nor left, but straight at the gardener,
and said: “All right then. But you mustn’t let
your feet dangle into the sea. And you must be very
frightened.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener restrained his feet, and became so
frightened that the whole vessel shook. The boy
continued to look doubtful, until his sister reminded
him in a hoarse whisper: “It’s all right, Aitch, we
were wanting somebody to walk the plank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In providing a willing villain, the gardener was
supplying a long-felt want in pirate-ships. So thoroughly
did he do his duty that when he was finally
obliged as a matter of convention to walk the walking-stick
blindfolded, and die a miserable death by
drowning in the gravel-path, the pirate-ship seemed
to have lost its point.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s betend,” said the lady-pirate, “that Aitch
and me are fairies, and we touch you with our wand
and you turn into a speckled pony.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Greatscod, no,” said Aitch; for there are limits
to what a fellow of seven can betend in company.
“Don’t let’s have any fairying, my good Zed. Let’s
betend we’re just Aitch and Zed, and we’ll show the
prisoner the Secret Tree.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they set off, and the Nana, who might as well
have been a Nanning-machine for all the individuality
she put into her work, trotted behind them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Secret Tree was one of those secrets that
remain inviolate because it occurs to nobody to lay
them bare. It was an everyday little palm tree, exquisitely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>bandaged by Nature in cocoanut matting;
it was very fairy-like, and when you looked up at its
fronds in their infinite intersections against the sky,
you saw a thrill, like the thrill you see on a cornfield
curtseying in the wind, or in the light moving across
watered silk. In one of the folds of the palm tree’s
garment a White Pawn, belonging to Aitch, had
made his home. He lived there for days at a time—the
gardener was told with bated breath—and
the park-keeper never knew he was there. At night
he saw the fireflies light their lamps, and heard the
swift slither of the fearful scorpion; once he had
reported an adventure with a centipede three times
his own size. That pawn was the epitome of People
Who Stay Up Late At Night, and Are Not
Afraid of the Dark. A super-grown-up.</p>

<p class='c009'>On their way to the garden gate, each child held
a hand of the gardener, and the automatic Nana
walked behind. As they came out into the main
street, the gardener thought that the houses looked
like skulls—so white they were, and so soulless, and
their windows so black and empty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Greatscod,” said Aitch, “what is happening to
the church steeple?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For it was reeling in front of them, to the tune
of a paralysing open roar from underground.</p>

<p class='c009'>Behind them the automaton blossomed madly into
life, Nana fled shrieking back into the garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>Those two things happened, one by one, like sparks
struck out of a flaming experience. Then everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>happened at once, and yet lasted a lifetime. There
seemed not a second to spare, and yet nothing to be
done.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener felt unspeakably terrified, his mother
earth shot away from under him, truth was proved
false. He discovered that he had seized Aitch and
Zed, one under each arm; and later on—his memory
having vaulted the blank—he found that he
was lying on them in the gutter, and that Aitch was
yapping like a dog. Zed was crying, “Mother,
Mother.” And the gardener, with a quick vision of
some one watering a cool English herbaceous border,
also said, “Mother, Mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After a while a green beetle ran past his eye, and
he recalled the moment, and raised himself upon his
hands and knees. A fire of pain burnt him suddenly,
and he turned his head and saw a pyre of twisted
iron posts heaped upon his legs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The air was thick with strange sounds, muffled
as if from a gramophone. Some one quite near, but
unseen, was shouting, “Oh, Oh,” as regularly as a
clock’s chime. There was a rending wheeze behind
them, and the gardener looked round in time to see
a palm tree sink with dignity into a trench that had
been gashed at its feet. But that might have been
a dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>He felt absolutely sick with horror. His head
seemed as though it were all at once too big for his
skin. His whole being throbbed terribly in a sort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>of echo of the three throbs that had laid life by the
heels.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yock—Yollock—Yollock. A pounce, and then
two shakes, like a terrier dealing with a rat. Why
had one ever trusted oneself to such a risky crumb
of creation as this world? The gardener lost himself
in littleness. And presently found that he had
insinuated himself into a sitting position, and was
feeling very sick indeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was an earthquake,” remarked Zed, with
the truly feminine trick of jumping to foregone conclusions.
And she burst into tears, wailing still,
“Mother, Mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is funny we should both have thought of her,”
observed the gardener, forgetting that there was
room for more than one mother in this tiny world.
His eyes were fixed on a thin and fearful stream of
blood that was issuing from between two bricks in
the mass of miscellany that had once been a house.
“Blood—from a skull?” he thought, and fainted.</p>

<p class='c009'>For centuries his mind skirted round some enormous
joke. It was so big that he could not see its
point, and then again it was so little that he lost it.
At any rate it was round, and turned with a jovial
hum.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later on he was aware of the solution of a problem
which he felt had been troubling him all his life.
What colour was the face of a nigger pale with
fright? It was several colours, chiefly the shade of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>a wooden horse he had once loved, but mottled.
But the whites of the eyes were more blue than white,
they shone like electric light. With an effort he
fitted the various parts of his mind together.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo, constable,” he said in a voice he could
not easily control. “This is a pretty business, isn’t
it?” And he tried to rise, and to whistle a bar
or two, in an effort to assume the pose of the hero
who trifles in the face of death. But he could not
rise. He was pinned to the pavement by a leg that
seemed somehow to have lost its identity.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not in the least romantic to be hurt. There
is something curiously dirty in the feeling of one’s
own pain, and in the sight of one’s own blood, though
wounds in others are rather dramatic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Courtesy was a person who, without ever
trying to be sensational, was often unexpected by
mistake. Coincidence seemed to haunt her. Out
of the hundred streets that lay shattered in Union
Town that afternoon, she chose the one in which
the gardener lay, and, accompanied by the priest,
she bore down upon that unheroic hero, laden with
brandy and bandages. The gardener saw her large
face, frank as a sunflower, between him and the
yellow sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest was quite obviously a saviour. You
could see in his eye that he was succouring the
wounded. You could hear in his voice as he addressed
the terrified hotel porters who followed him
that he was busy rising nobly to an emergency.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“Why, gardener,” said Courtesy, in the tones of
one greeting a friend at a garden party. “You
here? I was wondering what had become of you.
Now what’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She poured him out some brandy, as though it
were the ordinary thing for a lady to offer to a
friend in the street. And the gardener’s world regained
its feet, he wondered why he had been so
frightened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor little mites,” said Courtesy to Aitch and
Zed. “They won’t forget this in a hurry, will
they?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There is something very comforting in the utterly
banal. That is why the instinct is so strong in good
women to make you a cup of tea, and poke the fire,
when you are crossed in love.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if she had been the suffragette&nbsp;...”
thought the gardener. He knew quite well that the
thing would not have been so well done, had it been
the suffragette. He was fully aware that the operation
of having his leg put into improvised splints, and
of being lifted upon a door, would have been much
more painful, had it been accomplished by the little
nervous hands of the suffragette, instead of the large
excellent hands of Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is discouraging to those of us who have spent
much money on becoming fully efficient in first aid
and hygiene and practical economy and all the luxuries
of the modern female intellect, to find how perfect
imperfection can seem.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“Thank you—you little darling,” said the gardener
with his eyes shut, when, after a few spasms
of red pain, he was safe upon the door. White-clad
hotel porters stood like tombstones at his head and
feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lor’ bless you,” said Courtesy. “Take him to
the St. Maurice, porter. It’s the only place left more
or less standing, I should think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not,” said the priest. “Excuse me, Miss
Briggs, there are thousands in this stricken town in
need of our help, and I should prefer that only the
gentler and worthier of the sufferers should come
under that roof. There are many excellent resting-places
where our friend here would be far more suitably
placed. You ought to know his character by
now, and you must think of your own good name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rot,” said Courtesy. “What do his morals
matter when he’s broken his leg?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remember you are also succouring these innocent
children,” persisted the priest. “Would you have
them under the same roof?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rot,” repeated Courtesy. “The roof’ll be all
right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dose little children&nbsp;...” said the policeman
suddenly. “He covahed dem when dat house was
fallin’. Verree brave gentleman. I chahnced to be
runnin’ by....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course he did,” said Courtesy. “The St.
Maurice, porter.” And seizing Aitch and Zed each
by a hand, she started the procession.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>The High Street looked as if one side of it had
charged the other with equally disastrous results to
both. At different points in it, fire and heavy smoke
were animating the scene. Distracted men and
women panted and moaned and tore at the wreckage
with bleeding hands. A little crying crowd was collected
round a woman who lay nailed to the ground
by a mountain of bricks, with her face fixed in a glare
of terrible surprise. By the cathedral steps the dead
lay in a row, shoulder to shoulder, with the horrid
uniformity of sprats upon a plate. Courtesy lifted
up Zed and called Aitch’s attention to the healthier
distress of a little dog, which ran around looking for
its past in the extraordinary mazes of the present.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener, swinging along painfully upon his
door, opened his eyes and saw the fires. To his surprise
he recognised the house which could boast the
highest flames. Its wall had fallen to disclose the
shattered remains of the rooms in which the gardener
had lately wrestled with despair. The bamboos
and the gorgeous garden watched unmoved the
pillar of fire that danced in their midst. There was
no sign of the wire-haired woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>But only one thought came to the gardener’s mind
on the subject. “Why she will see that. It is a
beacon from me to her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As a matter of fact she did not.</p>

<p class='c009'>A pretty woman, crying in a curious laughing voice,
ran into Courtesy’s arms. “My little babies&nbsp;...”
she quavered. “What a catastrophe. I don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>know where my husband is. There is a grand piano
on my bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is my mother,” said Aitch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come along to the St. Maurice,” said Courtesy.
“That’s where I am taking your babies to. Our
piano there is still in its proper place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they all followed the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somebody must go and find a doctor,” said
Courtesy at the door of the St. Maurice. She
looked suggestively at the priest.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he replied, “I wash my hands of the matter,
Miss Briggs. I consider this to be a judgment on
that young man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A judgment?” wept the mother of Aitch and
Zed. “Why, what has he done?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He saved the lives of your babies,” replied
Courtesy. “And anyway, a judgment needs a surgeon
just as much as a simple fracture.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yerce, yerce, only don’t ask me to help,” said
the priest. “I prefer to succour those deserving of
help.” And he went out into the street again. He
seemed wedded to the word succour. It is a pose
word, and fitted him exactly. Nothing but an earthquake
could have made this worm turn. But the
effect of the disaster on the priest was an obstinate
certainty that there was a Jonah in the case, and that,
as heaven was never to blame, the wicked were entirely
responsible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Lor’,” said Courtesy. “I’ll have to go for
a surgeon myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“I’ll go with you,” cried the mother of Aitch and
Zed, whose name, for the sake of brevity, was Mrs.
Tring. “I don’t know what has become of my
Dally” (who was her husband).</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somebody must sit with the gardener,” said
Courtesy, when she came back from a successful
search for an intact bed, into which, with the
help of a housemaid, she had inserted the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will sit with him,” said the harsh voice of Mrs.
Rust, as she rose from a seat where she had been
sitting with an enormous paper bag held in a rigid
hand. “I refuse to run about the streets with
brandy. All the old cats are doing that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Mrs. Rust,” observed Courtesy, whose
conventionality was not quite so striking after an
earthquake as it had been upon the comparatively
stable Atlantic. “I had clean forgotten that you
existed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” said Mrs. Rust. “I was buying mangoes
when the incident occurred. Perhaps the gardener
would like a mango.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps he would. I am so glad to see that you
don’t take the same view about the gardener as
the——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never take the same view,” barked Mrs. Rust.
“Show me the boy’s room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So the gardener saw that poisonous hair advance
along a shaft of sunlight that intruded through the
broken shutter.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“Your jug and basin are broken,” said Mrs. Rust.
“Disgraceful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, there are several things broken in this
town,” he said feverishly. “Windows and necks
and a heart or two.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Rust sat deliberately on a chair and burst
into tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was buying mangoes,” she sobbed stormily,
“from a black man with bleached hair. And the
whole of a shop-front fell out on him. One brick hit
my toe. I looked at the man through a sort of cage
of fallen things. It was as if—one had trodden on
red currants.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did you do?” panted the gardener.
“How fine to live in a world where things happen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ran away,” said Mrs. Rust shakily. “I didn’t
pay for the mangoes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would rather have had this happen,” said the
gardener after a pause, “and have broken my leg,
than have had an ordinary day to meet me on Trinity
Island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After another pause, he added: “But I have lost
the suffragette. And that is another matter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was she killed?” asked Mrs. Rust, steeling herself
against the commonplace duty of condolence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly not,” replied the gardener. “She is a
militant suffragette.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” said Mrs. Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How good the world is,” said the gardener, “to
provide such excellent material. The sea, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>earthquake, and a fighting woman to love. Just
think—an earthquake—on my first day. I am a
man of luck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have broken your leg,” Mrs. Rust informed
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have,” admitted the gardener rather fretfully.
“But then everything has its price.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good many other people have come off much
worse,” said Mrs. Rust. “I’m not complaining,
mind, but any other woman would say you were disgracefully
selfish. A lot of people are dead, and a
lot of other people’s people are dead....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The longer I live&nbsp;...” said the gardener, from
the summit of his twenty-three years, “the surer I am
that we make a fuss which is almost funny over
death. We run after it all over the world, and then
we grumble at it when it catches us up from behind.
It’s an adventure, of course, but then—so is—shaving
every morning. Compare death with—love,
for instance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He felt ashamed of this after he had said it, and
tried to cover it with a little laugh which shook him,
and changed into a yelp. After breathing hard for a
little while he went on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We who have survived this ordeal have gained
much more than we risked. I know that anything
is worth a risk, the risk in itself is the gain, and to
risk everything for nothing is a fine thing. Why
otherwise do we climb Alps, or hunt the South Pole?
In theory, I would run in front of an express train to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>save a mou. In theory I don’t mind what I pay for
danger. That’s why I love the suffragette; she
would risk her life for a little vote, and her honour
for a bleak thing like independence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you love the suffragette?” asked Mrs. Rust,
who was at heart a woman, although she believed herself
to be a neutral intelligence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do, I do,” cried the gardener, suddenly and
gloriously losing his pose of One Who Evolves a
New Scale of Values—in other words, the pose of a
Paradox. But his emotion awoke his nerves, and
for a while, although the suffragette obsessed his imagination,
pain obsessed the rest of the universe.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Courtesy and the doctor came in, they found
the gardener with a temperature well into three
figures. So for some time Mrs. Rust was not allowed
to see the patient.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time the gardener felt better, the earthquake,
in the eyes of the townspeople of Union, had
become not so much of a horror as a disaster, a thing
possible to dilate upon and even to lie about. The
homeless were beginning to look upon homelessness
as a state to be passed through rather than the end
of things, the bereaved were discovering little by
little that life may arise from ashes, and that sackcloth
may be cut quite becomingly. Those ghosts of
dead hope who still searched among the ruins were
looked upon as “poor things” rather than companions
in sorrow. Young nigger ladies, dressed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>pink and silver, flaunted their teeth and their petticoats
around the firemen who worked desultorily at
the little gaseous fires that broke out among the
lamentable streets. The one church that remained
standing was constantly full. (The picture palace
had met the fate it perhaps deserved.) There is
nothing in the world so saved as a saved nigger.
And nothing so lost as a lost nigger. After an earthquake
it always occurs to these light and child-like
minds that it is safer to be saved. The horse has
fled from the stable, but the door might as well be attended
to, and the padlock of salvation is not expensive.
Fervent men and women throng the pews,
shouting hymns down the back of each other’s neck,
and groaning away sins they do not realise, to the
accompaniment of words they do not understand.
Those who have lived together in innocent sin hurry
to the altar for the ring, which, to these harmless
transgressors, is as the fig-leaf apron of Eden, and
heralds virtuous tragedy.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the gardener became well enough to resent
being ill, he was allowed visitors, among whom was
one, by name Dallas Tring, Esquire. This was a
very honest man who, in spite of having an excellent
heart, believed that he always told the truth at all
costs. The only lie he permitted himself, however,
was constantly on his lips. It was: “I take your
meaning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was obviously unnatural to him to be enthusiastic.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>It is to most very honest people. He came into
the gardener’s room like an actor emerging from
stage fright on to the stage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You saved my children from being crushed to
death,” he said, and seized the gardener’s hands.
“Thank you, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, not at all,” murmured the gardener. “I
pretty nearly crushed them to death myself. Have
a whisky and soda.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This last is the Trinity Island retort to everything,
its loophole, its conversational salvation. The
average Englishman takes several weeks to acquire
the habit in the real Island style, but the gardener was
always more adaptable than most.</p>

<p class='c009'>Privately he did feel unreasonably conceited about
the rescue. He would have admitted that the impulse
to gather Aitch and Zed beneath his prostrate
form had been unconscious, but he considered that
unconscious heroism proves heroism deeply ingrained.
Nevertheless, the people who voice your conceit for
you are only a little less trying than the people who
relieve you of the duty of being humble. One must
do these things for oneself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Dallas Tring was glad to have accomplished
his duty, which was not spontaneous, but had been
impressed upon him by his wife. Left to himself he
would have said: “Say, that was good of you. I’d
have been cut up if anything had happened to the
kids.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His wife not having warned him how to proceed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>he began now to talk about the banana crops. It
was only towards the end of the interview that he
risked himself once more upon the quicksands of emotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, you know, it’s altogether unspeakable—what
I owe you. Those are the only children
we have. Aitch is a fine boy, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fine,” agreed the gardener, relieved to be allowed
a loophole of escape from, “Not at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a fine boy yourself,” added Mr. Tring.
“When you get well, will you come and help me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To start again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes,” replied the gardener. “I love starting
again. What I never can do is to go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After this the gardener, considered to be stronger,
was allowed to see Mrs. Rust again. She was now
but little better than a fretful echo of Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some people seem born to walk alone, and others
there are who are never seen without a group behind
them. Courtesy was as far a leader of men as can
be compatible with having no destination to lead
them to. She never knew what it was to be without
a “circle.” Acquaintances were as necessary to her
as air, and she used them, as she used air, innocently
for her own ends.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Rust never attained to the dignity either of
being alone or the leader of a group, though she
worshipped independence. She believed she had
bought precedence of Courtesy for £200 a year.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>And on the occasion of this visit to the gardener,
she believed that she was about to shock and surprise
that wise young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know what I have done?” she asked,
when she had to some extent overcome the nervous
cautiousness of behaviour impressed upon her by the
absent Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not,” said the gardener, whose gently irreverent
manner towards her was his salvation in her
eyes. “It’s sure to be something that any one else
would be ashamed of doing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Rust bridled. “It was partly to annoy you
that I did it,” she said. “Because you dared to
advise me not to. I have sent my son Samuel a
cheque, so as to launch his hotel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rash woman,” protested the gardener. “If
you knew your son Samuel as well as I do——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know he is my son, so he cannot be altogether
a fool.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener bent his thick threatening eyebrows
upon her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know what else I have done?” she continued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tremble to think,” replied the invalid.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have advertised for your suffragette in the
Union Paper. Courtesy said what a mercy it would
be if she should have got safely away and wouldn’t
come back, so I advertised, just to show that I disagreed.
I never knew her name, so I described her
appearance....”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“Her little size&nbsp;...” he said eagerly. “Her
small and hollow eyes. Her darling-coloured hair
that always blew forward along her cheeks....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I didn’t put it like that,” said Mrs. Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She had such wonderful little hands,” said the
gardener, upon whom a sick-bed had a softening, not
to say maudlin effect. “You could see everything
she thought in her hands. They were not very white,
but pale brown. You might have mentioned them.
But she is obviously mine. Nobody could overlook
that. Nobody could overlook her at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the contrary,” said Mrs. Rust, “she is a
perfectly insignificant-looking young woman. And I
am sure that she would strongly resent your describing
her as though she were a dog with your
name on its collar. She had sensible views about
women.”</p>

<p class='c009'>You have been intended to suppose all this time
that the suffragette had succumbed to the earthquake,
but as she is the heroine—though an unworthy one—of
this book, I am sure you have not been deceived.
Loth as I am to admit that a friend of mine should
have been so near to such an experience without reaping
the benefit of it, I am obliged by tiresome truth to
confess that she was never aware of the earthquake
as an earthquake at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was in the train when it happened, a little
Christian the Pilgrim, making her way through many
difficulties up to the Delectable Mountains. Far off
they stood, defying the pale sea and the pale plains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>shadowed mountains, each with its cool brow
crowned by a halo of cloud.</p>

<p class='c009'>The train service in Trinity Islands is not their
chief attraction. First, second, and third class alike
may watch the vivid country from the windows, otherwise
there is no compensation for rich or poor.
The price of a first-class fare is supposed to guarantee
your fellow-passengers matching yourself as nearly
as possible in complexion; it also entitles you to a
deformed wicker chair in a compartment that a cow
would appeal against in the Home Country. The
wicker chair, unsettled by its migratory life, amuses
itself by travelling drunkenly around the truck, unless
you lash yourself to the door-handle with your
pocket-handkerchief, or evolve some other ingenious
device.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette was always without inspirations in
the cause of comfort. She was a petty ascetic, and
never thought personal well-being worth the acquiring.
Her body was an unfortunate detail attached
to her; she resented its demands, and took but little
more care if it than she did of the mustard-coloured
portmanteau, another troublesome but indispensable
part of her equipment. She put her body and the
portmanteau each into a wicker chair in the train,
and promptly forgot how uncomfortable they both
were.</p>

<p class='c009'>(There is much fascination in the big world, but I
think the most wonderful thing in it is the passing of
the little bubble worlds that blow and burst in many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>colours around you and me every minute of our lives.
In a ’bus or at a ball, in a crowd around a fallen
horse, meeting for a moment as reader and writer
of a book, or shoulder to shoulder in church singing
to a God we all look at with different eyes, these
things happen and will never happen exactly that way
again. How I wondered at the cut of your moustache,
O stranger, how I wondered at the colour of
your tie.... But your little daughter with the thin
straight legs and the thin straight hair pressed to your
side, her glorying face filled with the light of novelty,
and prayed that drive to heaven might never cease.
And next to you was the girl who had just discovered
the man by her side to be no saint, but a man. And
he was trying by argument to recover his sanctitude.
“But strite now, Mibel, I never dremp you’d tike it
so ’ard. ’S only my bit of fun....” There was
the man in khaki, next to me, born an idler, brought
up a grocer’s assistant, and latterly shocked into becoming
a hero.... There was the conductor, a
man of twisted humour, chanting the words of his
calling in various keys through the row of sixpences
that he held between his lips, while the little bell at
his belt tolled the knell of one ticket after another....
A little oblong world glazed in, ready to my
hand. But I got out at the Bank, and the world
went on to Hammersmith Broadway.... These
things are, and never shall be again. The finest
thing about life is its lack of repetition. I hate to
hear that history repeats itself. My comfort is that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>history is never word-perfect in so doing. Fate has
always some new joke up her sleeve. Sometimes the
joke is not funny, but certainly it is always new.)</p>

<p class='c009'>There were two Eves and an Adam in the world
which evolved from chaos under the suffragette’s
eyes, as the train moved out of Union station. Also
a dog. We are never told about Adam’s dog, but I
am sure that he had one, and that it wagged its tail at
him as he awoke from being created, and snapped at
the serpent, and did its best to propitiate the angel
with the flaming sword.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dogs seldom ignored the suffragette. As a race
they have either more or less perspicacity than ourselves—you
may look at it as you will—and they
seldom concur with the public verdict of humanity on
its own species. And in the suffragette a confiding
dog was never disappointed, for she knew the exact
spot where the starched buckram of one’s ear is sewn
on to one’s skull, on which it is almost unbearably
good to be scratched.</p>

<p class='c009'>This dog was the sort whose name is always
Scottie when he is owned by the unenterprising. He
wore his forelegs so short and so bent that he looked
as though he were continually posing as being thoroughbred.
When he drew himself up to his full
height, the under outline of his figure was about three
inches from the ground. When at leisure he walked
broadly and foursquare, as a table would walk, if
endowed with life; when speeding up, he cantered
diagonally—forefeet together—hindfeet together—no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>one foot moving independently of its twin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sort of conversation that this dog and the
suffragette immediately began did not prevent the
latter’s hearing the conversation that was woven by
her fellow-passengers across the loom of the train’s
roaring.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fact that the dog’s name was really Scottie
should give you a clue as to his mistress’s character.
It was perhaps malicious of me to describe her as an
Eve; that would have made her blush. For she was
very fully clothed in blue serge. It is almost impossible
for the average woman to conduct the business
of life except in blue serge. We travel in blue serge
(thin for the tropics, thick and satin-lined for our
native climate), we sit at our desk in blue serge, we
meet our Deity or our stockbroker in blue serge, in
blue serge we raid the House of Commons. Perhaps
the root of the feminist movement lies in blue
serge. If I were defended by a crinoline, or rustled
in satin or gingham or poplin, I might have been an
exemplary spinster in my sphere to-day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other Eve, attired (for she was obviously
cosmopolitan) in fawn tussore, occupied an undue
fraction of the little universe. She was the sort of
person whose bosom enters a room first, closely followed
by her chin. Black eyes and a hooked Spanish
nose led the rear not unworthily. She intended
to be looked at, and she hoped to be recognised as a
notorious novelist. For she was a momentary novelist
with a contempt for yesterday and no concern at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>all for to-morrow. A public of a hundred thousand
housemaids was all she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the virtues of men is that they are not intended
for fancy portrayal. Why should one ever
describe the outward surface of a man, unless he is
the hero of one’s book, or unless one is engaged to
marry him? The particular Adam in this compartment
comes under neither of these headings. He is
copiously reproduced all over the world, but clusters
thickest in Piccadilly. Possibly you see him at his
best very far away from Piccadilly. There is something
that transfigures the commonplace in the fact
of having kissed the very hem of the Empire’s wide-flung
robe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say, Miss Brown, how’s Albert?” asked the
young man.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the other occupants of the little world seemed
mutually familiar. It occurred to the suffragette that
Fate always threw her with people who knew each
other and did not know her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Brown, the Eve in blue serge, bridled. To
all women so flawlessly brought up as Miss Brown,
there exists a sort of electricity in the voice of man
which sends a tremor across their manners, so to
speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Albert, Mr. Wise, is still very weakly. I sometimes
wonder whether I shall rear him. His mental
activities, I am told, have outgrown his physical
strength.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man fanned himself. And indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>mental activities sounded unsuited to the climate.
The sun spilt square flames upon the floor through
the window. The silhouette of the passing landscape
scorched itself across the sky-line. Tattered
bananas looked like crowds of creatures struck mad
by a merciless sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>The voice of the lady novelist seemed to reach the
suffragette through a veil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That child will make his mark. He has the
most marvellous mental grasp....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Two hills to the northwest moved apart in the
middle distance, like the curtains from a stage. And
there was Union Town lying white beside her sea,
white, but veiled by her green gardens. Port King
George, on an attenuated isthmus, stretched its parallel
form along to shield the mother coast from the
Atlantic. Even from here you could see the white
gleam of the ocean’s teeth, as they gnashed upon the
reef. A spike of calm steel water lay between Union
Town and her defending reef. The suffragette
thought: “A skeleton in the grass with a sword beside
it....” She also looked at the toy figure of
the <em>Caribbeania</em>, so close to land as to be disguised as
part of the island. Her two funnels mingled with
the factory chimneys by the wharf.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he is sure to have landed by now,” thought
the suffragette. She felt unsentimentally interested
in the fact. It was too hot to feel more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I happened to mention the Book of Genesis,”
said the lady novelist. “And Albert produced a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>most ingenious theory about the scientific explanation
of the fable of creation. I wish I had such a nephew.
What a marvellous link with the coming generation!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the other hand,” said Mr. Wise, “I happened
to mention <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and he said it
was out of date, and, as a dream, most improbable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry he criticised the Bible in your hearing,”
apologised Miss Brown. “I am afraid he has
a tendency towards irreverence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish he had,” muttered Mr. Wise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Acres of sugar filed past the window. High
waved the proud crests of it, all innocent of its mean
latter end as a common comestible. The suffragette’s
mind laboured under a rocking confusion of
green tufted miles,—and somewhere on the outskirts
of her thoughts, a little sallow Albert entrenched behind
an enormous pair of spectacles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A glorious child,” said the lady novelist, in her
monopolising tones. “Simply glorious. Quite an
experience to have met him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good copy, eh?” grinned Mr. Wise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excellent. You know I collect copy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the suffragette collected copy, but she did it
without self-consciousness. There are several kinds
of copy-collectors. Some of us squeeze our copy
into little six-shilling novels, or hack it into so many
columns for the benefit of an unfeeling press. Some
of us live three-score years and ten, and then wake
suddenly to find our copy-coffers full. Upon which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>we become bores, and our relations hasten to engage
a paid companion for us. But some of us carry our
lives about with us sealed up in our holy of holies,
and take pride in hiding the precious burden that we
bear. Copy-collecting may become a religion; to the
suffragette, who never put pen to paper for any one
else’s benefit, and who never told an anecdote, this
pursuit was the great consolation for a bleak life.
At the gate of death, or on the step of Paradise, such
a soul may be found filling its pockets with the gold
of secret experience. I think the mania is most acute
when no thought of eventual print intrudes. Its
most encouraging characteristic to the lonely is the
sense of irresponsibility it brings. After all I may
go and turn cart-wheels down the Strand, I may murder
you, or throw my last shilling into the Thames, I
may go half-way to Hell, and if I miscalculate the distance
and fall in—it’s all copy. To the lady novelist,
however, copy was but a currency to spend.
Every experience in her eyes formed a part of a
printed page, surrounded by a halo of favourable reviews.
She never wrote a letter without an eye on
her posthumous biography, never met a notable individual
without taking a mental note for the benefit of
a future series of “Jottings about my Generation.”
Both she and the suffragette kept diaries, but only the
suffragette’s had a lock and key.</p>

<p class='c009'>The engine was approaching the climax of its daily
task. It faltered. Looking out of the window, Mr.
Wise described its arrival at the foot of a pronounced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>hill. The engine gazed up the perspective of its
duty, and panted prophetically, as pants an uncle
before a game of stump-cricket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This hill is always a surprise to the engine,” said
Mr. Wise. “Every day it has two or three tries,
and yet it never learns the knack.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette’s fingers tore at the arm of her
chair. It was not only too hot to travel, it was also
much too hot to cease to travel. She felt a crisis approaching.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her window had stopped artistically opposite a
little slice of distant world, carved out between the
trunks of two great cotton trees. Union Town, perceptibly
diminished since its last appearance, languished
again around its bay. Against the white
water you could see the cathedral and the factory
chimneys, the spires of God and the spires of mammon.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette, as she looked, saw the cathedral
spire cock suddenly awry and bend over, like a finger
in three joints.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The heat,” she thought. “I believe I’m dying.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost at once after that the train suffered a great
spasm, as though yearning for the top of the hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s going to try again,” said Mr. Wise.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette’s head cocked suddenly awry, she
bent over in three joints like a finger, and slid off her
chair in a faint.</p>

<p class='c009'>A prostrated suffragette is a contradiction in terms.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>This one became a child, lying in ungraceful angles,
in need of its mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By Jove!” said Mr. Wise. Miss Brown, after
lifting up her skirt carefully, knelt upon her petticoat.</p>

<p class='c009'>An ebony ticket-inspector rushed into the compartment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ull right! Ull right!” he shouted. “Ull ovah!
Nobuddy killed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly not,” said Mr. Wise. “Why should
they be? Only a faint.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Earthquake, sah, earthquake!” yelled the inspector.
“Jes’ look at the steeple daown in
taown!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no steeple to look at.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My—what an eventful journey!” said the lady
novelist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor little thing,” said Miss Brown to the suffragette,
in almost human tones. “Better now, better
now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette began to struggle a little. Even
had she been in her grave, I think pity would have
aroused a spark of militant protest in her bones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell her to make an effort,” said the lady novelist,
who had never in her forty years been guilty of
physical weakness. “Pretend not to notice her.
Probably hysteria.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This well-worn accusation touches a familiar chord
in the ear of any rebel. It opened one of the suffragette’s
eyes. She had black eyebrows which suggested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>that she might have fine eyes, but she had not.
When her eyes were shut you only saw the hopeful
suggestion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, come,” said Miss Brown, handing Mr.
Wise’s brandy flask back to him, and becoming aware
that her petticoat was bare to the gaze of an unmarried
gentleman and a negro inspector. “Might I
trouble you to lift the young lady on to a chair?” she
added, as she rose.</p>

<p class='c009'>Seven stone of political agitator takes but little
time to move.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A most eventful journey,” said the lady novelist.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Brown, now decently seated on a chair,
stroked the suffragette’s hand. “Are you going to
friends, my child?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, enemies, I expect,” said the suffragette
drearily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must know where you are going,” said the
novelist severely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Booked to Greyville,” said the inspector, who
had picked up her ticket, and was thoughtfully clipping
it all over.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know any one in Greyville?” asked Miss
Brown.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were you going to an hotel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Some kind deeds are so obvious that they are impossible
to escape.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Albert can move into the back room,” said Miss
Brown.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the train, as if relieved to have this affair settled,
moved on up the hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time the chapel bell, which Island engines
always wear, had begun to sound its warning to the
pigs upon the line at Greyville Junction, the suffragette’s
independence was a thing dissolved. Her
protests had no weight. Constitutionally she was
unable to be politely firm. She must either be militant
or acquiescent; she knew not the half measures
of civilisation. And it was impossible to be militant
in the face of Miss Brown’s impersonal sense of duty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If only she had been a more interesting person
this might have been like the beginning of a novel,”
murmured the lady novelist to Mr. Wise. That
young man, who was wearing the sheepish look
peculiar to the Englishman in the presence of matters
which he considers to be feminine, shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Greyville station Miss Brown emerged like an
empress from incognito. A black coachman, with
so generous an expanse of teeth that you suspected
them of being the only line of defence between you
and the inner privacies of his brain, was on the platform.
He seemed torn between acquired awe of
Miss Brown, and an innate desire to conduct the welcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>heartily. The station-master bowed. The
porter chirruped to Scottie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“New visitor, missis?” gasped the coachman,
looking at the suffragette. He had taken some time
to assimilate the visitorship of the lady novelist.
His mind was being educated at too great a speed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gorgeous fellow,” said the lady novelist, who
considered all black people gorgeous because they
were not white. The conversation of John the
coachman had already filled two note-books, though
he had never said anything original in his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is so much superfluous sunshine in Trinity
Islands that splashes of it have been lavished upon
all sorts of unnecessary details, the lizards, and the
birds, and the self-conscious orchids roosting in the
trees. Some of it has even been rolled into the
roads, making them white and merry and irresponsible.
The buggy horses feel the tingle of it, for
they seldom walk; although the Creator specialised
in hills on Trinity Island.</p>

<p class='c009'>Down from some lofty market came the peasant
women; their children, their donkeys, their tawdry
clothes, trappings and merchandise, soaked with sun.
Fantastic in outline, fairies of a midsummer day’s
dream, the little donkeys capered on spindle legs,
bestridden by wide panniers, and by the peasant
women, riding defiantly like brigands, with bandanas
round their heads, and sun-coloured draperies.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is curious that fashion has not yet decreed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>mania for dyeing one’s complexion mahogany, that
one might wear flame-colour with impunity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The buggy scattered the marketers. The Island
horse, a plebeian creature of humble stature, seldom
meets with the luxury of feeling superior. But the
Island donkey is nothing but a door-mat on four legs,
clogged red with the hectic mud of its mother land.
A cheap-jack’s pony would feel a prince beside it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Wise, who had been met at the station by a
very small brown boy with a very tall brown horse,
had cantered away in another direction, with a message
of greeting to Albert, the sincerity of which
Miss Brown had possibly overrated.</p>

<p class='c009'>A bungalow crouched behind a copper-coloured
hedge upon the sky-line. Two cotton trees surveyed
it, one on each side. A drive of the violently ambitious
kind shot at an impossible angle up to its door-step.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is Park View, my home,” said Miss Brown.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, as your dog’s name is Scottie,” murmured
the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Brown looked surprised. The poor suffragette’s
attempts at polite interchange of fatuities
never seemed to meet with the usual fate of such
efforts. Her trivialities somehow always fell upon
silence; if she ventured on the throwing of a light
bridge over a gap in the conversation, it seemed to
snap communication instead of furthering it. She
was, of course, unlucky, but she was also, it must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>admitted, too earnest in intention for petty intercourse.
She tried too hard.</p>

<p class='c009'>The buggy, commending its springs to the mercy
of Providence, charged the drive of Park View.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the door-step, carefully posed, Albert was reading
a very large book. He started laboriously as
the buggy approached, and placed the book under
his arm, taking care that the title should be visible.
An emaciated child, with manners too old, and
clothes too young, for his years.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have dot bissed you at all, Ah-Bargaret,” said
Miss Brown’s genial nephew. “I have been too
idterested id by dew book od Chebistry. I ab quite
sorry you have cob back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chemistry,” retailed Miss Brown to the lady
novelist. “A child of ten. And—did you notice,
he was so deep in his book, he got quite a start
when we arrived.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Albert, at Park View, met with that appreciation
of his poses which we all hope to meet in heaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Albert, you are to move into the back room,”
said Miss Brown.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?” asked Albert.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To make room for this lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Priceless child,” said the lady novelist in brackets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because she needs somewhere to rest,” said Miss
Brown in a voice of tentative reproof.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But so do I.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had better move into the back room myself,
then,” sighed his aunt.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>The suffragette began those hopeless protests
which make the burden of an obligation so heavy.
It is so very much easier as well as more blessed to
give than to receive, that the wonder is that generosity
should retain the name of a virtue. Up to a
certain point we are all altruists, because it is too
much trouble to be otherwise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Albert, who, having gained his point, was once
more comparatively genial, prepared to bring the suffragette
to his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I expect you are wudderig what is the dabe of
the book I ab readig,” he suggested to her as she
stepped shakily from the buggy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I was not,” she replied gently. “I’m
afraid science bores me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wha-t a lot you biss,” observed the child.
“You probably spedd your precious time id dancig,
ad dressig yourself up, ad bakig berry. How buch
better——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Albert,” said his aunt, “this lady is tired and
waiting to pass.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but I ab speaking to her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette smiled at him, and gave him her
portmanteau to carry.</p>

<p class='c009'>The earthquake at Union Town had shot the most
lurid rumours into Greyville. All the Park View
servants had suddenly gone to church. The whole
village was enjoying an impromptu half-holiday.
The triangular village green, which held Greyville
together and formed the pedestal of the Court-house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>echoed with news at every stage of exaggeration.
One of the mildest rumours was that Union Town
had fallen into the sea. It was said on the highest
authority that the Devil had run along the streets,
throwing flames right and left. No actual news arrived,
the sources of news being wrecked, but
towards evening all the Americans whose cars had
survived the ordeal suddenly invaded the hills, suffering
from nerves and a lack of luggage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Brown says she does not believe in doing a
thing unless you do it thoroughly. She says this as
if it had never been said before; she propounds it as
one propounds a revolutionary theory. But unlike
most theory makers, she always translates such boasts
into action. She performed the feat of keeping a
militant suffragette in bed for the rest of that day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette lay and imagined the gardener and
the earthquake at different stages of contact. She
thought of him fighting to get out of a falling house,
and her eyes shone. She thought of him with his
head bound up, and wriggled where she lay. She
thought of him unhurt, walking with his usual gait
as though he were marching to a band, and this
thought left her neutral. She never thought of him
dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>She never believed in death either as a punishment
or a reward. She had either lost the art of faith, or
else she had never found it. She pictured death as
a blink of the eyes, as an altering of the facet turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>towards life, never as a miracle. She was the only
person I ever knew who honestly looked on death as
unworthy of contemplation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course if a friend steps round a corner, you lose
sight of that friend. But you must get used to the
windings of the road. If you are a suffragette, you
have to be your own friend. You must not stretch
out your hands to find the hands of another; you
must keep them clenched by your side. On the other
hand, even a suffragette is human—(I daresay you
have doubted this)—and my suffragette was only
a little less human than you or I. The fact must
stand, therefore, that when she thought of the gardener
in pain, she forgot to clench her fists.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may still be a mystery to you why the suffragette
should expend ingenuity in running away from her
only friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you are a rebel of thorough nature, you believe
that your cause is such a good cause that no supporter
can be worthy of it. And, in the effort to reach
worth, you may possibly arrive, step by step, at the
Theory of the Hair Shirt, to which my suffragette
had attained. For in throwing her little weight on
the side of the best cause she could see, she cowed:
“All my life long to discard everything superfluously
comfortable or easy. To despise peace, and to love
loneliness....”</p>

<p class='c009'>This is the texture of the Hair Shirt worn beneath
the armour of a rebel. You may call it hysteria.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>And perhaps you are perfectly right. But perhaps
there are even better things than being perfectly
right.</p>

<p class='c009'>The night on the Island falls as abruptly as though
he who manages the curtain had let go the string by
mistake.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the night came a trayful of supper for the
suffragette, and with the supper came Albert, not of
course in the useful rôle of supper purveyor, but only
as an ornament.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This earthquake id Udiod Towd seebs to have
beed quite a catastrophe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite,” agreed the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I caddot picture ad earthquake,” continued
Albert. “I suppose doboddy cad picture such ad
urheard-of disaster.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can,” said the suffragette. “I expect my picture
is all wrong, but it’s certainly there. I see it red
and grey, which is the most vicious discord I know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Red ad grey?” repeated Albert. “Why red
ad grey? What for idstadce is red, ad what grey?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why,” said the suffragette rather lamely, “I
suppose the quaking is red, and the pain grey.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You seeb to be talking dodsedse,” said Albert,
with creditable toleration. “I expect the flabes are
red, ad the sboke grey. However, go od with your
picture.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think the world would suddenly give a lurch
to one side, and you would wonder what had happened,
and why you felt so sick. Before you realised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>anything else you would notice a sort of dazzle of
chalk-white faces all round you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The people are dearly all degroes id Udiod
Towd.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you would understand, but still you
wouldn’t believe that this thing was really happening
to you. You would see the houses curtsey sideways
in a leaping dust, and a house front, with its windows,
all complete, would shoot across the street with an
unbearable roar, pricked by cracking noises....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why would it dot fall od you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because things don’t. And there would be a
great chord of screams. And men running a few
yards this way or that, and then back again, yelping,
with lighted pipes still in their mouths....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What ad ugly picture. How cad you see it all
so clearly?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have been thinking all day—of a friend of
mine, who must have seen it. I don’t expect an
earthquake is a pretty thing, although there is something
beautiful about any curious happening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I doad’t agree with you,” said Albert. “There
are oadly a few beautiful thigs. Roses&nbsp;... ad
sudsets&nbsp;... ad love....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really, Albert,” protested the suffragette, “what
do you know about love?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if it cobs to that—what do you dow about
earthquakes? I cad picture love, easily. A bad,
kissing a girl, udder a cocoadut palb....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense,” exclaimed the suffragette, bounding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>so violently in her bed as to cause a serious storm in
her soup. “Kissing’s not love. Everything that
was ever said or written about kissing, I think, must
have been said or written by a man. It’s only another
of their tyrannies, to which, for the sake of
love, women have had to submit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You sowd like a suffragette whed you talk like
that,” mocked Albert.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No wonder,” she replied. “I am one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Albert looked shocked to find himself in the presence
of such a monstrosity. He went at once to
warn his aunt. And she replied: “It doesn’t matter,
Albert dear, she’s only staying a few days, till she
is well enough to make other plans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette, left to her cooling soup, reviewed
her theories and her practice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the good of being hard?” she asked
herself, “if you are not hard enough? Either you
are harder than the world and can bruise it, or the
world is harder than you and bruises you. There
is no point in just having a hard crust. As well be
dough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the middle of the night there was a loud wail
from Albert’s room. The suffragette, whose room
adjoined his, was the first on the spot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I seeb to have a bad paid,” cried Albert, who was
always cautious in his statements, “id the heart. It
feels like cadcer, I thigk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think so,” said the suffragette. “Perhaps
you are only in love.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>She went and knocked on Miss Brown’s door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I doad’t wadt Ah-Bargaret,” said Albert, as
his aunt came in. “I should hate to die lookig at
Ah-Bargaret. I ab sure I ab going to die.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll see that you don’t,” said the suffragette, as
she began to rub his side, his poor little ribs, furrowed
like a ploughed field.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you are an invalid yourself,” objected Miss
Brown jealously. “You had better go back to bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doh, she is dot ad idvalid, she’s a suffragette,”
whined Albert. “I doad’t wish her to go back to
bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Even Albert, with his wide range of scientific ways
of being inconvenient, could scarcely have chosen a
more impossible moment for an illness. Next day it
became apparent that every doctor on the Island who
had survived the disaster had plunged into the whirlpool
of its after effects. Nursing on the Island is in
a rudimentary stage at all times, but what nurses existed
were not to be dragged now from Union Town.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lady novelist said: “I know I must appear
heartless, dear Margaret, not to be helping to nurse
him, but the sight of suffering gives me such acute
pain.... It’s not heartlessness, you see, it’s that
my heart is too tender.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish she would go to an hotel then,” said the
harassed Miss Brown to the suffragette. “She
wants her meals so good and so regular, and I seem
to hate the sight of food just now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was against the suffragette’s principles to hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>anything so desirable without translating her hope
into action. It was also beyond her powers to be
diplomatic.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you had better go to the hotel,” she said
militantly to the lady novelist. “You would be better
fed there, and we should be more comfortable
alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In that case perhaps I had better, not being welcome
in my friend’s house,” replied the novelist. “I
was going to suggest it myself, as the sound of that
priceless child’s cries wrings my heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette therefore gained her point at the
expense of tact, which, as future historians will note,
is a characteristic of suffragettes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Albert’s temperament was not that of the Spartan.
He never ceased to cry for a week. As for the pain,
it was as if the god—whoever he may be—who
likes little children to suffer, sat beside him, and with
a blunt shears sliced off the top of each breath.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Albert clung to the suffragette, the straw in his sea
of troubles. His constant wail rose an octave if she
ventured from the room.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>The only holiday she had during that first week
was half an hour on the second evening of the ordeal,
half an hour spent in carrying the lady novelist’s
majestic suit-case to the hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>John the coachman could not do it, as the road to
the hotel was infested with “duppies” after dark.
The probability of meeting a “rolling calf” with a
human head and green eyes, or the duppy of some
regrettable ancestor, robbed even a tip of its splendour.</p>

<p class='c009'>The carrying of the suit-case was a physical impossibility
to one of the suffragette’s lack of muscle.
But to her impossibility was only an additional
“Anti” to fight, a rather worthier enemy than the
rest. She believed in the power of the thought over
the deed, that was her religion, and one is tempted to
wonder whether any more complex belief is needed.
Has it ever been proved that the human will, if reverently
approached, is not omnipotent?</p>

<p class='c009'>At any rate the suit-case, borne by a thing that
looked like the suffragette, but was in reality a super-suffragette
created for the occasion, travelled to the
hotel, unmolested by duppies, but followed by a literary
lady poisoned by injured pride.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the hotel were many Americans who said, “I
guess” and “Bully” and “I should worry,” and all
the things that make a second-rate copy collector
swell with copy and feel exquisitely cosmopolitan.
This collector’s diary began to overflow to three or
four foolscap sheets a day, closely covered with dialogues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>on trivial subjects by very ordinary American
husbands and fathers; all Americanisms underlined
and spattered with liberal exclamation marks.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of the second week of the lady novelist’s
stay at the hotel arrived a millionaire, who immediately
became the gem of the collection. He
was exactly modelled on the stock millionaire to be
met with in the pages of the comic papers. He was
lean, self-made, and marvellously dressed; he wore
eyeglasses and a little stitched-linen hat tilted over
them. Also the beard of a goat. At the very outset
he expressed himself, “Vurry happy to meet you,
madam, always happy to meet any of our neighbours
from across the duck-pond.” It was almost too good
to be true. The novelist followed him about, so to
speak, with fountain pen poised.</p>

<p class='c009'>His conversation was almost entirely financial.
Neither the lady novelist nor I understand such matters
well enough to write them down, but only I am
wise enough not to try.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mind if I say you are a treasure?” asked
the lady novelist, after listening for an hour to a dissertation
on Wall Street.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all, ma’am,” replied the millionaire politely,
and drew breath to continue his discourse.
But he rewarded her by descending to the level of
her intelligence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, talking of money, I guess there’ve been
more fine opportunities lorst in Union Town this
last fortnight, than ever I missed since I commenced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>collecting the dollars. Would you believe me—there’s
a fellow, by name Dallas Tring, who’s inherited
the only flour dee-pot in Union Town. Uncle’s
orfice crumpled in on Uncle during the quake,
and left Tring his fill of dollars right there for the
picking up, so to speak. Union Town wants flour
at this crisis, and if it was mine I’d say that Union
Town, or the British Government, had darn well
got to pay for it. We don’t calc’late in hearts, this
side of heaven, but in hard dollars. Philanthropy’s
a fool-game.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are simply priceless,” said the lady novelist.
“Please go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going right on, ma’am,” said the treasure.
“Would you believe me, this Tring e-volves a system
(save the mark) by which he gives away this
flour—gives it away, mind you, gratis, free, for
nothing, with a kiss thrown in if required, to any
nigger cute enough to rub his little tummy and say
he’s feeling empty. You may reckon I just couldn’t
quit Union Town without a call to see if the man was
an imbecile or what. I found a young cub with a
curly smile playing around in the orfice. Say, what
do you suppose he answered me when I told him
‘Good-morning, and what’s this sentimental money-chucking,
anyway?’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am dying to know,” said the lady novelist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Said it was the foyrst time he’d ever been led
to think there might be something in sentiment after
all. I was fair rattled.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>The young cub with the curly smile, as you may,
with your customary astuteness, have guessed, was
the gardener. He had assumed the pose of philanthropist,
which, when conducted at some one else’s
expense, is one of the most delightful poses conceivable.
The pleasure to be found in helping the dirty
destitute seems to need an explanation beyond the
plea of altruism. There is a real charm in domineering
to good purpose. To say unto one man Go
and he goeth, and to another Come and he cometh,
is at all times pleasant, but when such a luxury as
autocracy becomes a virtue, there are few who disregard
its glamour.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener’s broken leg recovered as quickly
as any leg could have done. He had an enthusiastic
and healthy attitude towards suffering and illness,
an attitude which he took instinctively, and which
mental scientists and faith-healers try to produce artificially.
He was always serenely convinced that
he would be better next day. He lived in a state
of secret disappointment in to-day’s progress, and
unforced confidence in to-morrow’s. He might be
described as a discontented optimist; though often
convinced that the worst had happened, he was always
sure that the best was going to happen. Conversely,
of course, you can be a contented pessimist,
happy in to-day, but entirely distrustful of to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the gardener’s methods may perhaps be ascribed
the fact that in a fortnight he was able with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the help of a stick, and with the encouragement of
Aitch and Zed, to walk about his room. His first
excursion was to the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>The houses opposite had fallen in on their own
foundations. One complete wall was standing
starkly amid the mass. Portraits of the King and
Queen and a text or two still clung to their positions
against the stained and florid wall-paper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you see that house that you just can’t see,
the other side of that wall?” asked Aitch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I see,” said the gardener. “I mean I just
can’t see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s where dead Uncle Jonathan lives,” said
Aitch. “He’s left Father the flour in his will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How good of him. I hope it was a pretty one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Father said, ‘There’s a fortune there.’ And
Mother said, ‘Oh, Dally, it’s as if it was left in
trust for poor Union Town.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the gardener next met Mr. Tring, he discovered
how entirely sufficient for two are the opinions
of one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I’m awfully lucky, in a way,” said
Mr. Tring. “It’s a big inheritance, and hardly
damaged at all by the earthquake. But at present,
of course, it’s all responsibility and no returns. I
feel as if it’s sort of left me in trust for Union
Town.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s one way of looking at it,” said Courtesy—surely
the least witty comment ever invented.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t agree with you at all,” said Mrs. Rust,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>who now made this remark mechanically in any pause
in the conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You consider that Mr. Tring should pile up a
big bill against the British Government?” suggested
the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stuff and nonsense,” said Mrs. Rust. “I consider
the niggers can eat—mangoes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sometimes wonder,” said the gardener,
“whether one has a duty to oneself. One feels as
if one has, but I always—in theory—distrust a
duty that pays.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly one has a duty to oneself,” said Courtesy.
“Duty begins at home. That’s in the Bible,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most of the texts tell you your only duty is to
the man next door,” said Mr. Tring, blushing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I entirely disagree with you,” said Mrs. Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after this discussion Mr. Tring, inspired by
his wife, produced a plan for the benefit of the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When this business is over we shall—I mean
I shall be a rich man and a busy man. I need somebody
young around. I’d like fine to buy your youth
(his wife’s words). What about being my secretary
for the present? It might give you a start in
Island business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is not a time for paid work,” said the
gardener, “with half the money on the Island gone
to dust.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I take your meaning,” said Mr. Tring. “But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>in my opinion the time’s all right. Good work’s
good work, whether it’s honorary or not. I never
liked the idea that there’s something heroic in refusing
money, making out that there’s something
mean in accepting it. If you help you help, and the
help’s none the worse if it makes you self-supporting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The word “self-supporting” was a sharp and accusing
word to the gardener. Most of us privately
possess certain words that search out the tender parts
in our spiritual anatomy. The words “absolute
impossibility,” for instance, angered the suffragette
to militant protest; the mention of “narrow-mindedness”
ruffled the priest’s sensibilities; as for me, the
expression “physical disability” hurts me like a
knife. It may or may not be out of place to add
that the effect on Courtesy—that practical girl—of
an allusion to “banana fritters” was to make her
feel sick. You may know people better by their
weaknesses than by their strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>The word self-supporting, therefore, goaded the
gardener into accepting Mr. Tring’s offer.</p>

<p class='c009'>His stock of poses, though very wide in range,
had not as yet extended as far as practical business,
in black and white, hours ten to five daily. He had—I
report it with disgust—a contempt for the pen
as a business implement. He was himself an artist
without expression, a poet caged; a musician in desire,
he suffered from a mute worship of all art.
And he believed that the pen was as sacred an instrument
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>as the violin, or the palette. To make
money by the pen in business was equal to fiddling
on a kerb-stone, or designing picture post cards.
These theories are pose-theories, of course, and untenable
by the practical man. But some of the gardener’s
poses had crystallised into belief. He was,
as you may have noticed, anything but a practical
man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps,” said Mr. Tring, “you might be what
my wife calls an ‘out-of-doors secretary.’ I have
been officially asked to organise the distributing of
the flour. Enquiries will have to be made. The
niggers are awfully sly, you know; you’d have
thought they’d be too silly to be sly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have noticed that the silly seem to be protected
by Providence. Slyness seems to be given as a sort
of compensation. Otherwise, of course, we should
stamp out the silly, and a lot of valuable human
curiosities would become extinct.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I take your meaning,” said Mr. Tring. “That
being so, if we found you a horse to ride about on,
would you undertake the notification and examination
of the necessitous cases, the pruning away—as
my wife would say—of the dishonest applicants.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am a gardener,” said the gardener. “I love
interfering with nature. Mr. Tring, you are a most
excellent friend to me. Thank you seems too little
a word.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There are only a few people to be met with who
can do justice to such a thankless task as the expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>of thanks. Man under an obligation is always
convinced that the conventional words are not
enough, and tries to improve on them. This must
always be a failure, however, as improving on convention
is a work that only genius can undertake
with success.</p>

<p class='c009'>A horse was found for the gardener. He was
what might be called an anxious rider, and Courtesy,
after watching his first equestrian exhibition, went
to some trouble to find him an elderly mare of sober
propensities. Mounted upon this excellent creature,
the gardener one morning threaded the little passes
that had been made in and out of the crags of ruined
Union Town. It was early. The Olympians had
not yet begun to compound that horrible broth of
sun and steam and dust which they brew daily upon
the plains of the Island. The sun’s eyes had not yet
opened even on the most ambitious of the hills, but
the sky was awake, and so clear that you might have
thought you were looking through crystal at a blue
Zion. The dew was laughing in the crushed gardens.
Grey lizards with a purple bloom on them
jumped from ruin to ruin over chasms of ruin. A
humming-bird, looking as though its tail and beak
had been added hurriedly out of the wrong box,
stood in the air glaring into the open eye of a passion
flower. The air was shining cool. The songs
of the birds were like little fountains of cold water.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is always a pessimistic gloom about the
woods of the Island. The cotton tree, with its ashen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>blasted trunk, looks as if it had known a bitter past.
Logwood gives the impression of firewood left
standing by mistake. And the cocoanut palms, which
are unstable souls, lean this way and that, as though
glancing over their shoulders for their enemy the
wind, against whom they have no defence. Only
the great creepers throw cables of hope from tree to
tree, and the orchids nestle blood-red against the colourless
hearts of the cotton trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>The huts for the homeless had been built in a
wide clearing in the woods, only divided from the
sea by the road, a belt of palms, and a frill of sand
so white that the word white sounded dirty as you
looked at it. The rocks leant out of opal water
into pearl air. A pensive pelican, resting its double
chin upon its breast, stood waiting on a low rock.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener dismounted with great care. A
person of three summers or so came to watch him
do it. The only thing she wore that nature had not
from the first provided her with was a hair-ribbon.
Her head looked like a phrenologist’s chart. It
was mapped out in squares by multiplied partings
at right angles to each other. From every square
plot of wool sprang a rigid plait of perhaps one
inch in length. On the highest plait was a scarlet
hair-ribbon. The effect was not really beautiful,
but suggested a beautiful maternal patience. The
person thus decorated was gnawing a piece of bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That bread,” thought the gardener, who in
flashes posed as Sherlock Holmes, “must have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>made with flour. That flour probably came from
Tring’s. Where did you get that bit of bread,
Miss?” he added.</p>

<p class='c009'>The person, determined not to appear to overlook
a joke for want of an effort, gave a high fat
chuckle, and danced the opening steps of a natural
tango. The gardener, unwilling to shatter the illusion
of his own humour, did not repeat the question.
He gave the elderly mare in charge of not more than
a dozen little boys. It was an insult to the mare,
a creature with a deep sense of responsibility, who
could much more reasonably have taken charge of
the little boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dat Mrs. Morra’s pickney,” said one of the
older boys, with a polite desire to effect an introduction
between the gardener and the dancing person.
On hearing herself thus described, Mrs. Morra’s
pickney at once led the way at great speed to Mrs.
Morra. Now Mrs. Morra’s was the first name on
the gardener’s list of applications.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was discovered outside the door of her hut,
submitting the head of an elder daughter to that
process of which the coiffure of the younger was a
finished example. The conversation was punctured
by wails from the victim. Wool does not adapt itself
to painless combing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good morning, Mrs. Morra,” said the gardener,
with his confiding smile. Mrs. Morra
screamed with amusement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hear the earthquake knocked down your home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>and didn’t leave you anything to live on. You asked
for some of the free bread, didn’t you? The police
gave us your name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“P’leece?” questioned Mrs. Morra, who seemed
amused by the mention of her necessity. “Whe’
dat, please?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The police—the big man in blue,” said the gardener,
before he remembered that on the Island the
police was always a little man in white.</p>

<p class='c009'>“P’leece?” persisted Mrs. Morra.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The policeman—the law,” said the gardener
desperately.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every nigger is familiar with the law. Going to
law is a vice that on the Island takes the place of
drink. The nigger’s idea of heaven is a vast courthouse,
with the Almighty sitting at a desk awarding
him damages and costs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, de law—de polizman, please sah,” said
Mrs. Morra.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right. Now how did your little girl get this
bread?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beg a quattie from a lady, please,” said the
mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but where did she buy the bread when she
had the quattie. Bread is free now, you can’t buy
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bought it fim Daddy Hamilton, please, old man
who live alone by himself across opposite. But he
ha’n’t got no more, please!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll go and see Daddy Hamilton,” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>gardener. “How many children have you got, Mrs.
Morra?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How many children?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How many pickneys?” said the gardener, inspired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pickneys please thank you,” said Mrs. Morra.
“I got Dacia Maree Blanche Rosabel Benjum Teodor
Lionel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seven,” panted the gardener, who had kept careful
count.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tree, please sah,” corrected the lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me Dacia Maree,” explained the victim of maternal
pride.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you a husband?” continued the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O la, no please sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A widow?” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Morra shrieked with laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nebber had no man mo’ dan tree monts,” she
said. “Dacia Maree’s fader—he on’y stop a
week. Benjum’s dad bin in gaol two yahs.
Blanche Rosabel—her fader was a brown man, her
grand-dad was a buckra.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener blushed into his notebook.</p>

<p class='c009'>The police had certified that the family’s means of
subsistence had been swept away by the earthquake,
and the gardener, by one glance into an unsavoury
hut, satisfied himself that no luxuries had been
saved from the wreck. He therefore noted the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>case as needy, and asked his way to Daddy Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c009'>This gentleman, seated upon an upturned bucket,
was studying a hymn-book through a pair of horn-rimmed
spectacles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“God bless you, sah,” he said in the loud unmistakable
voice of a joyous Christian.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener thanked him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see, Mr. Hamilton, that you told the police you
had two married daughters whose husbands had been
killed by the earthquake, and seven grandchildren
dependent on you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yessah. De Lawd giveth, an’ de Lawd taketh
away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. And you had an emergency grant of
several loaves of bread on Monday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Praise be to God, sah, I did. De Lawd
giveth——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the contrary, in this case it was Mr. Tring
that gave. Now, are either of your married daughters
or any of your grandchildren at home?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sah. Dey all gone to chapel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really? Now there seems to be an idea among
your neighbours that you live by yourself. How is
it they have never noticed your two daughters and
seven grandchildren?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dunno, sah. Deir eyes dey hab closed, lest at
any time dey should see wid deir eyes, and hear wid
deir ears——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do the whole ten of you sleep in that little hut?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“No, sah, I sleep on de graound aoutside. Foxes
hab holes——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Mr. Hamilton, can you look me in the
face and tell me that the bread that was given you
was really eaten by yourself, and two daughters, and
seven grandchildren?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sah. To tell you de troot, sah, dey wasn’t
ezackly blood-grandchildren. All men are brudders,
we are told, sah, and derefore grandchildren, an’
daughters, an’ nieces too, sah. All de pickneys call
me Daddy Hamilton. Suffer de little children to
come unto me, saith de Lawd, so I suffer dem
gladly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but do you ever charge anything for suffering
them? Have you ever sold any of the bread
that was given you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sah, a man mus’ live.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but the bread was given you to live on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sah, money is better dan bread. You ask
for bread and dey give you a stone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not in this case. The bread was excellent.
Do you know, Mr. Hamilton, I believe you are
liable to be prosecuted for obtaining Mr. Tring’s
gift under false pretences.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sah, not false. I am a faitful sojer in de
Lawd’s army, sah, faitful an’ joyful. Old Joybells
dey call me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Still, this time I’m afraid you stepped aside.
I will ask Mr. Tring what he would like done
about it. At any rate, you won’t get any more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>bread given you for the present. I’ll see to that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“God bless you, sah. De Lawd giveth, an’ de
Lawd taketh away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All novelties are interesting to One Who is Seeing
Life, but novelty is unfortunately an elusive
phantom to pursue. After a fortnight spent in inquiry,
the gardener began to feel his heart sink at
the mention of flour. He suffered from the gift of
enthusiasm, in place of the gift of interest, and enthusiasm
is like the seed that fell upon stony ground,
the suns of monotony scorch it quickly. To do the
gardener justice, it must be admitted that there was
very little left to do. Union Town was not very
long in adjusting itself to the emergency. Nigger
huts are quickly built, and even the villas of the
coffee-coloured aristocracy, the most serious sufferers
from the disaster, are not the work of ages. The
Post Office continued to lie upon its face in the High
Street, but the bare feet of the people soon trod a
path around it. Government House remained huddled
in a heap upon its own cellars, but Governors,
after all, are not human, and it makes but little difference
to the population to hear of its viceroy sleeping
under canvas.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the gardener’s mind, during the past fortnight,
the suffragette had had Union Town as a serious
rival. His vanity was a little hurt by her continued
lack of appreciation of a great man. He would
have liked, while still on crutches, to have met her
searching among the ruins for him. So for a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>while he posed as being in love with his work. But
when Union Town began to retire into the background,
the suffragette stepped forward into insistent
prominence. She triumphed finally one night in
the verandah of the St. Maurice Hotel, after dinner.
It was a night without a flaw, every star spoke the
right word, and the moon was a poem unspeakable.
Fireflies starred the garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll have to return to the search,” said the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What for?” asked Courtesy, who always liked
everything explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For the suffragette,” he replied. “I’m tired of
being respectable and in doubt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Luckily the priest had changed his table since
Courtesy had changed her company. He sat at the
far end of the verandah, with his back to every one.
His righteousness had subsided to some extent since
the earthquake, but he still looked on the gardener
as a hopelessly lost lamb. Such a shepherd as the
priest may yearn towards the lost lamb, but would
rather not sit at the same table with it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you start that silly game again, gardener,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>said Courtesy, “you’ll have to throw over Mr.
Twing’s job. Why can’t you leave the girl alone?
She can’t have been killed, because there are no
white people left unidentified. Why can’t you stick
to one thing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no glue in me,” replied the gardener.
“I’m glad of it; there could be nothing duller than
sticking to one thing. Besides, there’s nothing left
to stick to. There was only half an hour’s work to
do yesterday, although I spent three hours over
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Rust shot a fountain of tobacco smoke into
the air as a sign that she intended to speak. The
priest liked Mrs. Rust, because his own tolerance of
her vagaries made him feel so broad-minded. He
liked to smile at her roguishly when she took a small
whisky and soda; he liked to hand her the matches
when she smoked; he liked to write to his sister at
home: “One comes in contact with a worldly set
out here, but if one is careful to keep one’s mind
open, one finds points of contact undreamt of at
home in one’s own more thoughtful set.” If the
gardener had been a drunkard instead of being in
love, the priest would have liked him better. But
the gardener posed as being a non-drinker and a
non-smoker on principle. Really the taste of spirits
or of tobacco smoke made him feel sick.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am going to leave Union Town myself,” said
Mrs. Rust. “I know of a car I could hire to-morrow.
I will help you in your search, gardener, although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>she strikes me as being a totally unattractive
young woman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We had arranged to go to the hotel in Spanish
City next Wednesday by the nine train,” said
Courtesy in a reproachful voice; “and from there
to Alligator Bay, and then in a car round the Island.
I daresay other plans might be made, but you should
have let me know sooner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No plans need be made,” said the gardener rebelliously.
“We might just get the car, and start
now in the cool.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ass!” observed Courtesy simply. “Mrs.
Rust’s lace scarf won’t be dry enough to iron till to-morrow.
I will see whether we can start the next
day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To disobey Courtesy was unthinkable. The gardener
gritted his teeth at the stars, because he would
have to see them again before he could start on his
search. <em>Now</em> was the only time for the gardener;
<em>then</em> hardly counted; and <em>presently</em> was a word he
failed to acknowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anyway, you don’t either of you know where to
look for her,” said Courtesy, that practical girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll be at Alligator Bay,” said Mrs. Rust.
“They’ve got a picture gallery there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll be somewhere in the hills,” said the gardener.
“She would always go up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I entirely disagree with you,” retorted Mrs.
Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anyway, it seems hot on sea-level,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Courtesy. “We’d better go up to where it’s supposed
to be cool. I’m told the Ridge Pension, High
Valley, has a good cook, but the New Hotel, at Greyville,
is also well spoken of.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately thirty-six hours, though they may
stretch half-way to eternity, never succeed in covering
the whole distance. A moment arrived when
the three, bristling with travellers’ trifles, met the
waiting car at the nearest spot in the ruined High
Street to which cars could penetrate. And then followed
a long series of dancing moments. Little village
ports strung like beads along the coast; thatched
huts thrown together by a playful fate; waterfalls
like torn shreds of gauze draped on the nakedness of
the hills; logwood plantations, banana plantations,
sugar plantations, yam plantations.... Then as the
approaching hills began to usurp more and more of
the sky, the road cut through a high and low land;
hand in hand with a very blue river, it threaded a
great grey crack in the island; high cliffs yearned
towards each other on either side; a belt of pale sky
followed the course from above. Then out into the
sun and wild woods, with ferns and flowering trees
beckoning beautifully from all sides. And then
long hills, a road that doubled back at every hundred
yards, with a great changing view, growing bigger,
on the right hand or the left, as the course of the road
decided. Little brown villages clung desperately to
the hill-side; gardens of absurd size balanced themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>on almost perpendicular slopes; paths of red
mud, disdaining the winding subterfuges of the road,
sprang from angle to angle, like children playing at
independence beside a plodding mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>Towards the afternoon a blue-black cloud crept
suddenly over a summit, and emptied itself with
passion upon the travellers. In a minute the waterproof
hood of the car was proved unworthy of its
name; the screen in front became less transparent
than a whirlpool; the road went mad and believed
itself to be a mountain torrent. The wet wrath of
heaven began to make itself felt even down Mrs.
Rust’s neck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is disgraceful,” said Mrs. Rust. “Courtesy,
do something at once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>No doubt Courtesy would have risen to the occasion,
but for once Heaven was quicker. The sun
suddenly shouldered its way round the intruding
cloud, and made one great shining jewel of the world.
Park View, that forward house, residence of the retiring
Miss Brown, stood bold upon the sky-line.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener’s heart did not leap within him when
he saw Park View. Only in books does Fate disguised
stir the heart to such activity. In real life,
when I stumble on the little thing that is to change
my life, I merely kick it aside, and hurry on.</p>

<p class='c009'>In case you should think that by bringing my
travellers to Greyville I make the long arm of coincidence
unduly attenuated, I must add that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>are only two tourist centres on the hills of the Island—Greyville
and High Valley—and that almost
everybody visits both.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener was now posing as a Seeker, and instinctively
his eyes took on the haggard look that
belongs to the pose. As he mounted the steps of
the New Hotel verandah, the lady novelist thought,
“What an interesting young man!” When, however,
she saw Mrs. Rust’s hair, her notebook trembled
in her pocket. The Treasure had left, and as
to the other Americans, she had practically drunk
their cup of copy dry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Charles,” she said to the woolly black waiter
when he brought her tea, “will you put those new
people at my table?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, please, missis,” replied Charles, who, being
a head waiter at seventeen, was suffering from
the glamour of power. “Shall sit dem wid Mistah
Van Biene.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A fraction of the proceeds of the lady novelist’s
last novel, however, soon silenced the authority of
Charles.</p>

<p class='c009'>And after all it was Mrs. Rust who sought acquaintance
first, at breakfast in the cool verandah
next morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There was a lizard in my bath,” said Mrs. Rust.
“Disgraceful! Why can’t you exterminate your
vermin?”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was hard on the lady novelist, who screamed
for Charles whenever she saw anything moving anywhere,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>but she bore the injustice with a beautiful patience.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you think of the Island in general?”
she asked. “I can tell by your face that your opinion
would be worth having.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She might have added that she could tell this, not
so much by Mrs. Rust’s face as by her hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think of the Island if I can help it,”
retorted Mrs. Rust after some thought, during
which she sought in vain for some adequately startling
reply. “That earthquake—on my first day—a
revolting exhibition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, were you in Union for the earthquake? I
am collecting the reports of intelligent people who
were there. I am sure your adventures must have
been worth recording.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the contrary,” replied Mrs. Rust, “the
whole thing was absurdly overrated. My nerves
remained perfectly steady throughout.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener, the only person who might have
cast a doubt upon this statement, was not present.
Still posing as the strenuous seeker, he had gone
for a walk before breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is a great glitter about morning in the hills
which drags the optimist for long walks in the small
hours upon an empty stomach, and causes even the
pessimist to attack his grape fruit at breakfast with
a jovial trill. The little tables on the verandah of
the New Hotel have a glamour of heaped bright
fruit upon white linen. In the garden the tangerines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>grow radiantly among their shining sober green, the
butterflies blow across the pale young grass. There
is a salmon-pink azalea, whose smile attracts the
humming-birds, and a riotous clump of salvia.
There is a benevolent John Crow, who strikes attitudes
upon the roof of the annex, and stands for
hours with his ragged wings spread open to the sun,
as he surveys the diamond world. Really he is hoping
that you will fall dead over your breakfast, but
you lose this thought in the glitter of a hill morning.
For the sake of your own peace of mind, never get
close enough to a John Crow to see his gargoyle face.
Content yourself with admiring his barbaric grace
from a distance, and forget why he is there.</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy was characteristically still in bed. She
never was one to hear the call of a singing world.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener came in with eyes crinkled by the
sun, and his hair standing up in a spirited way all
over the top of his head. Did you know that it is
possible to be a specialist in posing without giving
thought to the appearance?</p>

<p class='c009'>“You look as if you had been fighting,” snapped
Mrs. Rust. “Disgraceful state of hair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I had,” replied the gardener. “I could
fight beautifully at this moment. I never knew
what it was to breathe until this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Air is indeed a blessing” said the lady novelist.
“I have a passion for air. I sometimes think I
should die without it. How interesting to meet any
one who loves fighting. You ought to be a soldier.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>I myself am a peace-loving woman, but I often have
quarrels forced upon me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me conduct them for you,” suggested the
gardener, wrestling with his grape fruit. “Show
me the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I could. I think I will,” said the lady.
“I came to Greyville to stay with a dear friend, and
a young woman, of no standing whatever, picked
up anyhow and anywhere, not only turned me out of
my friend’s house, but now insists on my moving
two of my trunks from the sick-room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, there is a sick-room, is there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my friend’s little nephew is ill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But didn’t your friend protest? Has the young
woman a hypnotic power over her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My friend is very weak. The young woman is
only a sort of second-rate children’s nurse, apparently.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do you want to go back there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I prefer to be here. But it is so undignified
not to be consulted.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s very true,” said the gardener, whose interest
was beginning to wane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That road below is as crowded and as noisy as
Piccadilly,” said Mrs. Rust. “Disgraceful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Market day,” replied the novelist rapturously.
“Such a blaze of colour. Such a babel of
tongues....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so smelly, I am sure,” said Mrs. Rust. “I
am going to market.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“Let’s all go to market,” added the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour had to be allowed for Courtesy to have
her breakfast, and for Mrs. Rust to don her panama.
Mrs. Rust, though not averse to startling any one
of her own colour, had a secret distaste for the naïve
criticisms of the niggers on her strange hair. The
Islanders were not aware that dyed hair was the
apex of modern fashion; they looked upon it, poor
things, as a deformity, and a most amusing one.
Mrs. Rust had been obliged to invest in a perfect
beehive of a hat for wear in such ignorant parts.</p>

<p class='c009'>So four more units joined the stream of marketers
along the red road. In spite of Mrs. Rust’s panama,
the niggers laughed. Niggers always laugh unless
they cry, and the lunatic ways of white women provide
a source of amusement that never fails, although
white women have been on the Island for
three hundred years. Some of the marketers actually
had to remove their baskets of fruit—crowned
with boots—from their heads, to give free
play to their sense of humour. Every nigger wears
his boots upon his head. It is, I suppose, as much a
disgrace not to own them as it is a discomfort to wear
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The appearance of the market was like a maniac
garden, and the sound of it was like a maniac rookery.
By way of compensation to the niggers for
their individual ugliness, Providence has granted
to them an unconscious beauty in the matter of grouping
themselves. A nigger by herself looks like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>comic picture post card, a lot of niggers together look
like the picture that many master-hands have tried
to paint.</p>

<p class='c009'>My senses tingle even now with the welter of
sun and sound and smell and colour, that constitutes
an Island market.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You meet every one in Greyville here,” said
the lady novelist to the gardener. “I will introduce
you to the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener agreed absent-mindedly. He was
helping Courtesy to buy baskets. The Island is the
paradise of basket lovers. Those hearts are rare
which do not thrill at the sight of a plaited basket in
many colours, and I believe that nobody ever left
the Island without succumbing to the charm. I suppose
the reason why Island baskets never get on to
the market at home is that everybody loves them so
much, they never part with them. Courtesy, who
always loved the popular thing, had been very busy
buying baskets since the first moment of her arrival.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Rust was busily occupied in refusing to buy
anything. “Buy a pine? Why should I? I
loathe pines. Lace? No, I won’t buy lace, my underclothes
are already overcrowded with it. What’s
that? A basket to keep my letters in. I keep my
letters behind the fire. Why, gardener—look—here’s——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Gardener,” tittered the novelist, “here is
the enemy behind you.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“You dream,” said the gardener, “I’ve been
looking for you everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With an amiable smile the suffragette allowed her
hand to be shaken an enormous number of times.
She was looking plainer than the gardener had expected.
With the pretty obtuseness of men, he had
in his dreams forgotten that brown hat with the
weary flowers in it. He had imagined her dressed
in blue, he had thought her eyes were blue to match,
he had created a little curl in her hair. Yet somehow
he was not disappointed. For he had also forgotten
in his dreams the comfort that lies in lack of
ornament. It isn’t love that makes the world go
round, it’s the optimism of men.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, it’s quite nice to see you again,” said the
suffragette in a voice of surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Courtesy,” shouted the gardener, “from this
moment I’m not a fit companion for Mrs. Rust.
Courtesy says I’m not respectable when I’m with
you,” he added to the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see anything very disreputable in your
behaviour with me,” she replied. “But it’s only
for a little while, Courtesy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Lor’, no,” said Courtesy. “He’s come to
stop.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t,” said the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener would never have put into words
the appeal that came into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said the suffragette, “you are thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>that I am growing more and more militant every
time you see me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was not,” he answered, “I was wondering how
I could manage to see you apart from all this noise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite easily. You can walk back to Park View
with me now. I have got the oranges for Albert.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they squeezed out of the market-place, and side
by side paced the avenue of donkeys which on market
days lines the village street.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you waiting for?” asked the gardener.
“What’s wrong with me? When will you
want me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t you I don’t want. It’s what you stand
for. Possibly I haven’t mentioned to you that I am
a suffragette of a special kind. A cat that walks by
itself.... Or rather perhaps it is presumptuous of
me to lay claim to cathood. I have only walked
such a little way. I am an elderly kitten, say, walking
by itself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if all suffragettes were like you, it would
certainly be an argument against the franchise. For
what would become of England?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“God forbid that all suffragettes should be like
me. I am a fanatic, a rather silly thing to be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know what you are waiting for,” said the gardener.
“Heaven! you want so much beside the
Vote, and you’ll never get what you want this side of
heaven.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“God forbid that I should want heaven,” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>suffragette. “Heaven is not made for women.
Why, the very archangels are men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why won’t you have me? We could get married
to-morrow. Why not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I am too busy. Because there is a superfluity
of women, and as I am not a real woman—only
an idea—I’d better sit out. Because I am
conceited and couldn’t bear my pride to have a fall—at
your expense. Because you don’t know me and
I don’t know you. Because it’s better to live alone
with an ideal than coupled with a fact. Now I’m
sick of talking about myself, it makes me feel sugary,
as though I’d been swallowing golden syrup neat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But before you retire into your militancy, tell
me,” said the gardener, “do you think you will ever
recognise this bond between us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is no bond between us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is love between us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry, but it’s not mutual.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Love is an automatically mutual thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I’m afraid that proves that whatever may
be between us is not love. Here is Park View.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Damn Park View!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Words are supposed to be a woman’s luxury, but
it always seems to me that men put a more touching
faith in argument than ever women did. I believe
the gardener thought that if Park View had been five
miles farther on, he might have made a woman of
the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“And what do you expect me to do now?” he
asked pathetically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get busy,” advised the suffragette, “somewhere
else. Dear little gardener, remember that this road
has been trodden before. Being young is a devastating
time, anyway. It always comforts me to think
that there are crowds before and behind me, and that
even a cow has had a delirious calfhood. After all,
the past is such a little thing, one can drown it in a
drop. And the future is so big.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s what I complain of—the size of the future.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, don’t. Size is space and space is
growth. Good gracious, what a prig I am becoming!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For God’s sake, come and fill up a little corner
of my big future, then. You little thing, I could
hold you in my hand.... And you can hold me with
no hand at all, but only with your heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why? Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was climbing the steep drive. She never
looked round. She always looked up.</p>

<p class='c009'>With excellent intentions the suffragette had, I
think, succeeded in killing her heart. She was so
heartless that even the hole where her heart should
have been was a very shallow one. Some rudimentary
emotion turned in her breast as she walked
up the drive, and if she could have had the gardener
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>as a friend, she would have turned even then and tendered
him the friendly mailed fist of the independent
woman. But if one is a fanatic, one cannot also
be a lover. She suffered from the cold humility that
sometimes attacks women. Every morning she occupied
three minutes in the thankless task of pinning
her hair into a shape conformable with convention’s
barest requirements, and was then confronted with
her own thin short face, white—but not white like
a flower as the face of a beloved woman should be;
her small eyes, grey—but not grey like the sea; her
straight and drooping hair, made out of the ashes of
the flame that burns in real women’s hair; her thin
pressed lips, her hard set chin, the little defiant wrinkles
over her brows.... It was impossible for her
to believe that such a thing could be indispensable to
any eyes. Her attitude towards the paradox was
always sceptical, and the idea that there is nothing a
woman can offer as a substitute for such a small gift
as herself was beyond her. The little ordinary fiery
things of youth had been shorn out of her life, she
had been crushed by the responsibility of being a
woman and a devotee.</p>

<p class='c009'>No man would believe that such a woman exists.
The pathetic vanity of man would never be convinced
that any woman could prefer her own independence
to his kisses.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time the suffragette had reached the front
door of Park View, the interview with the gardener
was but a pulse beating at the back of her mind.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Miss Brown, looking as nearly dishevelled as a
persistently Real Lady could possibly look, was
standing in the hall, ankle-deep in her own prostrate
property. Trunks yawned on every side, highly respectable
dresses, like limp ghosts of Miss Brown
herself, embellished every chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I haven’t even begun on Albert’s books
yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The more of Albert’s books we leave behind
the better,” replied the suffragette. “I have got
him <cite>Treasure Island</cite> to read on the boat, and he
might take that one on Chemistry for Sundays.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure I don’t know how you manage Albert,”
said Miss Brown. “I could never even get him to
read the Bible. It really looks as if Providence had
sent you to us at this crisis.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Providence would never have chosen a militant
suffragette.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, but really one wouldn’t notice your opinions,”
said Miss Brown in an encouraging voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about Scottie?” asked the suffragette.
“Has anybody thought what is going to happen to
him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t thought of any details,” answered Miss
Brown. “The doctor’s orders were so sudden, they
altogether upset me. I suppose Scottie can be
left with John.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope he won’t,” said the suffragette. “I
caught John using Scottie as a target yesterday. He
scored two bull’s-eyes before I got there.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>“I can’t think what to do with him. There is nobody
but Mr. Wise, and he already has a fierce bulldog.
Have you any ideas?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, one. I have a sort of friend on the Island.
If I left Scottie with him, he would act as a brake in
the pursuit, because of the difficulties of quarantine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t quite follow your meaning,” said Miss
Brown, not unnaturally. “I didn’t know you had a
gentleman friend on the Island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t. But I’m sure he will be kind to
Scottie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Very late that night, when Courtesy, Mrs. Rust,
the gardener, and an unknown young man picked
up at the club by the gardener, were playing Bridge
in the verandah, a very young boy with a very fat
dog appeared, asking for Mr. Gardener. The boy
was too well educated to be afraid of duppies. The
solid Scottie, too, was felt to be a sound defence
against the supernatural.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is this?” asked the gardener, who had
assumed the melancholy pose of the Rejected One,
and had unconsciously acquired a sad sweet smile to
correspond. Even on his death-bed the gardener
will pose as a dying man.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young boy put a note into his hand, and
dragged Scottie from the shadow where he had
modestly seated himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By Jove,” said the unknown young man, who
happened to be Mr. Wise. “It’s Scottie, the Park
View dog.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>The gardener literally burst the envelope open.
The enclosure said: “Dear Gardener—Will you
please keep Scottie until I ask you for him again.—Your
fairly sincere suffragette.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The note went round the Bridge Table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have always wondered,” said Mrs. Rust,
“whether politics were really good for women.
Now I am sure that they have an unhinging tendency.
What does it mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It means that they are going on an expedition,”
said Courtesy. “They want the dog looked after
for a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, but Park View is a regular palace in Greyville,”
said Mr. Wise. “There are three servants
in it, all competent to look after Scottie for a day or
two.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall have to do what she says,” said the gardener.
“The suffragette’s only fault is that she
leaves almost too much to the imagination.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy had vanished.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better go round and ask for an explanation,”
said Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He must play out these doubled lilies,” said
Mrs. Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It must be nearly twelve,” said Mr. Wise.
“The cocks have been crowing for an hour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Island cock proclaims the night rather than
the day. Not even a cock can feel much enthusiasm
for such a tyrant as the Trinity Island sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t go now,” said the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>But next morning at breakfast he said, “I daren’t
go now.” He had hardly slept at all, and looked
white. The light of the Seeker had gone out of his
eyes, there had been no wish in him for a wild walk in
the early sun. He was not even posing. He had
been pathetically late for breakfast, and Mrs. Rust
and the lady novelist had disappeared to read the
<cite>English Review</cite> and the <cite>Lady’s Pictorial</cite> respectively
on the front verandah.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why daren’t you?” asked Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Courtesy—she’s beaten me. She’s left
me without hope.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy took several mouthfuls of porridge before
she replied, “You’re young yet, gardener.
And she isn’t so extra unique, after all. If you like,
I’ll go round and ask for an explanation of the dog.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t know the way,” said the gardener
tragically.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was lucky that Mr. Wise at that moment arrived
in his buggy to invite Courtesy and Mrs. Rust
(if she wasn’t too tired) for a drive. The buggy
was a single one, and held two only, so there was a
transparency about his motives which did him credit.
Courtesy never even passed on the invitation to Mrs.
Rust, and the owner of the vehicle failed to repeat
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Armed with her inevitable box of sweets, Courtesy
set forth on her romance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ripping woods,” she said, as the sun winked
through the delicate lace of the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“Ripping,” agreed Mr. Wise. “But full of
ticks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy suffered that beautiful shock that attacks
a woman when she first realises that the man
by her side is an uncommon person, and that he holds
the same view about herself. She offered him a
chocolate cream.</p>

<p class='c009'>They went to Park View by the longest way possible,
but I think the nearest approach to romance
that they reached was when Courtesy said, “Oh,
Lor’, I am enjoying myself!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Mr. Wise replied, “So am I. I hope you’ll
come again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When they reached Park View they were neither
of them observant enough to notice the forsaken look
of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll just go and tackle that funny little
suffragette,” said Courtesy. “I won’t be half a
mo.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked back and smiled at him as she climbed
the drive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dey all gone, missis,” said John, who was sitting
in the hall, reading the letters out of the waste-paper
basket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gone? Where to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gone to Lunnon Town to see a doctah man,
please, missis.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Union Town, you mean.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, please thank you, missis. Gone lars’ night
to catch a big steamboat.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“How many of them went?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Missis Brown, and Mars’ Albert, an’ de visitor-missis.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know their address? Where are you
forwarding their letters to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>John laughed shrilly at this joke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Carn’t say, please, missis. Post-missis wouldn’t
send me de letters, now de fambly gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Island is the home of elusive information.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter with the woman, anyway?”
said Courtesy, as she remounted the buggy. “I
never can understand a woman that doesn’t know her
vocation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is her vocation?” asked Mr. Wise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ou, I don’t know,” giggled Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think all women ought to marry,” said Mr.
Wise. “Somehow it keeps them softer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wouldn’t make a hard woman soft,” said
Courtesy. “Only all the soft women do marry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you consider——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ou, Lor’, this is a killing conversation!” interrupted
the lady. “Let’s talk about something else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right. That’s a very pretty dress you’ve got
on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They found the gardener sitting on tenterhooks
on the verandah, pulling Scottie’s ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did she say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She didn’t. She’s gone to London.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope they’ll take care of Westminster Abbey,”
said Mrs. Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>The gardener said nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time the suffragette was putting romance
behind her by means of a little boat limping across
a heavy sea. Compared to the <em>Caribbeania</em>, this
boat was like my suffragette compared with Mr.
Shakespeare’s Desdemona. There was rust on the
little boat’s metal, and her paint still bore memories
of London smuts. The purser was occasionally to
be seen in his shirt sleeves, and the Captain had a
button off his coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest was on board, returning to his flock,
overflowing with material for sermons. By mutual
consent he and the suffragette ignored each other.
He made an attempt to approach Albert, with his
special children’s manner, but that cultured youth
quickly silenced him. So he occupied himself in trying
to save the soul of the second officer, a docile
youth, of humble and virtuous tendency.</p>

<p class='c009'>Within two days the little boat reached the Isthmus
which has lately been converted into one of the
wonders of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My poor Albert,” said the suffragette. “I’m
afraid the doctor says you mustn’t go to see the
Canal. It’s so dusty. And you know such a lot
about it, don’t you? It is disappointing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dow quite edough about it,” replied Albert.
“I have do wish whatever to see it. I dow every
detail of its codstructiod.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all right, then. The doctor says when
it’s cool after dark, you may walk as far as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>gardens behind the quay, and listen to the band.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do dot wish to hear the badd. I wish you ad
Ah-Bargaret to go away for the whole day, ad let
the youggest stewardess cob ad sit with be. She is
a charbig persod, ad it would be very good for you
to see the Cadal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In Albert’s eyes the halo of the suffragette was to
some extent evaporating. Her attitude towards science
alienated him in his capacity as an educated man,
although as a child in pain he still clung to her. And
she had that morning offended him by buying him a
bottle of sweets from the barber’s shop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I really thigk you sobetibes forget I ab do
logger a baby,” he observed, and forthwith began
to lay great stress on the charm of the youngest
stewardess.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Brown was delighted at the fall of her
nephew’s latest idol.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d better come away,” she said. “Let’s
go and see the Canal. If you stay with Albert when
he is displeased, you get on his nerves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they landed on the quay of one of the two
terrible towns that guard the entrances of the Canal.
They paid a great price and manned a train that cost
humanity a very great price indeed to create. That
train is built of dead men, the embankment on which
it runs has largely peopled purgatory, the very sleepers
might as well be coffins, yet the train moves with
the same callous rhythm as the train from Surbiton
to Waterloo. In it you may see the calm inheritors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>of the fatal past sit upon spread handkerchiefs upon
the smutty seats, and stick their tickets in their hats
that the passing of the conductor may not disturb
their train of thought; and all as if there were no
ghosts to keep them company. Only outside the
windows you can see the haunted land, white water
enveloping a dead forest, ashen trees suffering slow
drowning, tall grey birds standing amid floating desolation,
and the Canal, a strip of successful tragedy,
creeping between its treacherous red banks. The
train leaves the Canal for a while, and returns to find
it in a different mood. The First Lock is the crown
of that great endeavour. I am assured that much
more genius has been spent on the Cuts than on the
Locks, but to you and me, ignorantly seeking copy,
the First Lock triumphantly dominating the weary
water-way, seems like the seal of success, as if Man
had built this stupendous thing as a barrier between
him and failure.</p>

<p class='c009'>When you see the Lock you feel like an ant seen
through the wrong end of a telescope. The suffragette,
as she stood on the iron way that goes along
the top edge of one of the gates, had to think of all
the biggest things she had ever imagined to keep
herself from dwindling out of existence. Even
Women’s Rights grew small in the light of this man-made
immensity. She was standing on the highest
gate, and she could look across a perspective of three
empty cube-worlds, at the white Canal and the white
sea beyond it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“Really,” she said, “there is very little to choose
between God and Man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good gracious me, what a thing to say!” said
Miss Brown, bridling. “God could knock all this
down with one stroke.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He couldn’t knock down the spirit that would
make man build it up again. Why do we pray to a
Creator, if we can ourselves create?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you had better come out of the sun,” said
Miss Brown coldly. “I am feeling a little sick myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But on their way across the gate back to the white
paving that borders the Lock, they found their way
blocked by the priest, who was advancing in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is impossible for a stout Miss Brown and a stout
priest to pass each other on this route. Two suffragettes
might have passed, but fortunately for the
Isthmus there was only one present.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will retire,” said the priest. “Place aux
dames, yerce, yerce.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, how good of you!” said Miss Brown,
bridling. “I am sorry to put you to such inconvenience.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a jocular reference or two to goods trains at
a shunting station the priest retired from the
dilemma. But when they had all reached the safety
of the broad paving again he seemed to have shed
his desire to cross the gate. He was by himself,
which he detested; there were countless morals to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>humorously drawn from the Canal, and nobody to
point them out to.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a marvel of workmanship, is it not?”
he said to Miss Brown, pointedly excluding the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Brown agreed, and asked whether he had
felt pretty well on the voyage so far. Thus the
Canal introduced them, and when the acquaintance
was safely formed, Miss Brown strove to introduce
the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yerce, yerce,” said the priest hurriedly. “We
have met before. An introduction is unnecessary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately for the suffragette she saw a dog at
a little distance, and hurried to speak to it. The dog
is blessedly cosmopolitan. Wherever you may meet
him he speaks your home tongue to you, and his eyes
are the eyes of a friend in a strange land.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette and the dog walked along the side
of the Lock some twenty yards behind their elders
and betters, and the suffragette watched her character
falling in shreds between them. Some people like
safe hunting, and there is no prey so defenceless as
prey that is not there. The priest’s conscience had
been for some time accumulating reasons why the
modest Miss Brown should be warned of the true
character of her immodest companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette allowed them half an hour to finish
the destruction, and joined them at the train, when
the dog reluctantly remembered another engagement.</p>

<p class='c009'>The party returned to the town in dead silence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>At the station the priest left them, with promises to
come and read to Albert. The suffragette and Miss
Brown made their way across the gardens to the quay.
Under a great palm, Miss Brown stopped tragically,
and spoke to her companion for the first time since
leaving the Lock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I trusted you,” she said, rather dramatically,
though, of course, she was too ladylike for melodrama.
“I gave you my hospitality, I succoured you
when you needed help (this was an echo of the
priest), and all the while you deceived me, you took
advantage of my kindness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly you were all that to me,” said the suffragette
mildly, “and certainly I am very grateful
for all your kindness. But I don’t remember deceiving
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are an immoral woman,” said Miss Brown,
with a great effort, “and you never told me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is hardly expected that I should have told you
that. Partly because it would have been silly, and
partly because it would have been quite untrue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one could dislike gossip more than I do,”
said Miss Brown, who loved it. “But a priest is a
priest, and this one is such a truly nice man, so good-hearted,
never said a word yesterday when the steward
upset the soup into his lap. Why did you never
tell me that you travelled from England in company
with a man who was not your husband?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the suffragette, though she was distrustful of
the reasoning of men, seldom failed to see the point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>of view of a woman, even though that woman was an
anti. She specialised in feminism, and in her eyes to
be a woman was in itself a good argument.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I ought to have told you, Miss
Brown,” she said in a warmer voice than was usual
with her. “As a matter of fact it never occurred to
me that the thing was worth telling, but that, I admit,
is no excuse. I do see that I have been accepting
your kindness under false pretences. It is perhaps
useless to say I am sorry, and worse than useless to
tell you that I would rather die than be married, and
that I would rather be hanged than live unmarried
with a man. Still I admit I allowed all the fools on
the <em>Caribbeania</em> to think I was also such a fool as to
be married. I will not bother you again, Miss
Brown, I will keep out of your way as much as possible
on the boat. It’s only a fortnight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Brown was mollified, and when she spoke
again it was like the angel Gabriel sympathising with
the difficulties of a beetle. “Of course if you are
penitent,” she said, “I should like to help you to retrace
as far as possible the false step you have taken.
I believe there are Homes.... But perhaps you
had better not come near Albert.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little boat was indulging in a two days’ rest
at the Isthmus. It is a problem worthy of the superwoman
to avoid a fellow-passenger on a small boat in
port. The bearable space on board becomes limited
to inches. The side nearest the quay affords nothing
but coal-dust to breathe, the other side allows a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>percentage of air to dilute the coal-dust. There is no
scope for choice.</p>

<p class='c009'>After-dinner, however, Miss Brown settled down
to play chess with Albert. Chess with Miss Brown
is a most satisfactory game, a crescendo of “Checks”
leading to a triumphant “Mate” in a delightfully
short time.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the suffragette went on shore to listen to the
band.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Isthmus band is as gaudy in attire as it is
sombre in complexion, and it plays to a stratum of
society as striking to the eye as any in the world.
The Isthmus is the centre of nigger fashion. Here,
under the glare and the flare of a hot night in the
season, you may see the effect of a layer of civilisation
on an aboriginal worship of colour. Crimson, gold,
and silver are the prevailing motifs. As to the coiffure
of the ladies, for every plait to be found on a
Trinity Island head there are half a dozen on the
Isthmus. There is something uniquely wicked in the
appearance of rouge and powder on a mahogany
ground. The look of vice which the Parisian or
London lady strives to attain by means of a shopful
of cosmetics can be acquired by the lady-nigger with
one dab of the flour-dredger. Once more I pause to
ask when we may expect the decree that we must further
conceal our incurable virtue by means of a complexion
dyed copper colour.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a moon, and there were stars standing
aloof in the sky; and there were many lights about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the garden. There were shrill brass voices everywhere,
and the band was playing that tune of resigned
sentimentality, “My Old Kentucky Home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette felt slightly drunk. She had had
a day of emotions, and it was an unusual and intoxicating
experience for her to find her emotions escaping
from the iron bound cask in which she kept them.
She felt totally irresponsible, and when the priest
came along, looking as conceited as the moon, and as
sentimentally benign as the stars, she discovered a
lunatic longing to tear the hat from his head and
stamp upon it, to make him look a fool, to prick his
pride; not because of any personal enmity—or so
she thought—but because he seemed eternally on
the side of sanity and of yesterday, and barred the
path of young and mad modernity. She approached
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest suddenly perceived in front of him a
soul dangerously in need of salvation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear young lady, I have been seeking an opportunity
for a quiet chat with you, yerce, yerce.
Whatever you may think of me, I assure you that I
am not the hard and inhuman man you think me. I
should be only too thankful to be of service to you.
Let us sit on that quiet seat, away from the crowd.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is good of you to risk contamination,” said the
suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My calling leads me among the publicans and
sinners,” said the priest. “It is not my business to
divide the sheep from the goats.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“Not your business, but your pleasure,” suggested
the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest stiffened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you had not hardened your heart against
my help,” he said. “Believe me, I have every sympathy
with a young and unprotected woman in your
position. I think sometimes life seems hard on the
weaker sex, yerce, yerce.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a great honour to be a woman,” said the
suffragette. “Your God certainly turns his back on
the individual, but he is very just to the mass. The
day of women is just dawning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There may be something in what you say,” observed
the priest, feeling that she was somehow erasing
all that he had meant to say. “I am sure we
shall all be glad to see Woman come into her own.
But....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Men may possess the past, but women have the
future,” continued the suffragette, who was certainly
very much excited. “We have suddenly found what
you have lost—the courage of our convictions.
The art of being a fanatic seems to me to be the
pivot of progress; but men have lost, and women have
caught that blessed disease.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not see how all this applies to the matter in
hand,” said the priest. “Unless you are trying to
convey to me, by way of an excuse, the craving which
I am told possesses most women of your persuasion—the
craving for fame, the morbid wish to be talked
about.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>“I did not hope to convey anything at all to you.
And certainly not fame, for there is no such thing.
I have seen pigeons sitting on the heads of statues of
great men in London, and I have seen little critics sitting
on their fame. This is a world of isolated people,
and there can be no fame where there is no
mutual understanding.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are oddly pessimistic, and you are also wilfully
evading the point. When I saw you just now,
I hoped that you had repented of your sin and needed
my help.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have committed no sin that would appeal to
you,” said the suffragette. “But that is, of course,
beside the point. What you want is that I should repent
of being myself, and become a sort of inferior
female you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed you have come to hasty and mistaken conclusions
about my intentions,” said the priest, whose
principal virtue was perseverance. “Regarding
your political opinions, I have every sympathy with
your cause, though none for your methods. There
is something so very coarse about militancy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you ever tried denying a creature the food
it needs? I think you would find that even a white
mouse would be coarse if you starved it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may be right. My sister is a member of
the Church League for Women’s Suffrage. Perhaps
you also belong to that sisterhood?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” she answered. “I belong to the Shrieking
Sisterhood.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“It seems useless for me to try and help you in
this mood,” sighed the priest. “I can only pray that
I may be shown the way to your heart....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have none,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a garden not five hundred miles away from the
garden in which she sat was the Fact which she had
Forgotten, set in a silver light among the silver trees.
The gardener stood among the pale grape-fruit trees,
with his head back in his usual conceited way, with
his hands in his pockets and his feet in the wet
grass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is nonsense,” he thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is only half human.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Love for a thing only half human is only half
love.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can’t build a world out of words, as she tries
to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a thing like love, there is fact and there is
theory. Theory is only falsehood disguised as fact.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is not a bit pretty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe she would rather make an enemy than
make a friend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something has gone wrong with the woman of
to-day. She has left the man behind, but she has not
gone forward.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What have I been about to allow such a woman
to disturb me? I came to this island a king, and I
have made myself a slave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is youth that has burnt me. I am done with
youth. It is fine to have reached age in theory, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>yet in practice still to have one’s life ahead. My
youth has been a fire in my path, and she has stamped
it out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The moon explored the spangled sky. The fireless
interwove with the pale purring noises of the
night. The mad still shadows of the palms blotted
the grass.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener went into the verandah firmly posed
as He Who has Passed through Fire, and has
emerged, cured of the silly disease of youth, into a
pale silver light.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the gardener made his theories, while the
suffragette’s theories made her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener was awakened next morning by
the loud noise of Scottie chasing lizards across the
room. Scottie was a bristly Northerner, and never
became really used to the conditions of tropical life.
To this day he labours under the delusion that lizards
are only bald or naked mice, that have deceitfully
changed their smell and their taste.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener thought that he awoke perfectly
light-hearted. He did not recognise the curious
thing that throbbed in the back of his consciousness
as his heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>He whistled in his bath. He whistled as he came
out on to the verandah for breakfast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy had risen for early breakfast by mistake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stopped brooding?” she asked. “Brave boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two and two is such a poor formation after all,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>said the gardener. “One and one is much more
comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy giggled. “There are times,” she said,
“when two and two is ripping. Mr. Wise is coming
up to lunch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He came up to lunch yesterday. And he’s coming
up to tea to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yesterday and to-morrow are not to-day,” said
Courtesy, that practical girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener had not time to ponder, for Mrs.
Rust then appeared. Her complexion was even
more of a contrast to her hair than usual.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had a letter last night,” she said. “I didn’t
tell you at once, because it’s such a vulgar habit to
blurt out news. I don’t know whether I have mentioned
my son Samuel to you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have,” said Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So have I,” added the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“His house has played him false—I knew it
would. One of the ceilings gave way—on to
Samuel. Him and his house—he always was a
fool. I believe he thought the Almighty built his
house for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but what happened to Samuel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you—the ceiling fell on him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but what is the result?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, the rest of the house is still standing. It was
only one of the ceilings. He put the billiard table
upstairs, and probably had his rafters made of bamboo.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“Yes, but I mean what was the result as far as
Samuel was concerned?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was concussion. There have been one or
two people staying in the house since he started the
atrocious practice of advertising, and they had him
taken to a hospital. My letter is from the matron.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor Mrs. Rust,” said Courtesy, “you must be
terribly worried. I suppose you’ll be wantin’ to get
home by the next boat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stuff and nonsense,” snapped the mother.
“Haven’t you noticed by now that I have iron
nerves. Next boat—indeed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I should have thought——” began Courtesy,
and the gardener kicked her under the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is only one perfectly obvious thing to do,”
said the gardener, “and that is wait till the next mail,
a fortnight hence. Knowing Mrs. Rust as I do,
Courtesy, I am sure she will follow this obvious
course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Obvious course—indeed,” said Mrs. Rust,
much relieved. “Stuff and nonsense. I shall do
exactly as I please, whether it’s obvious or not. Suppose
I decide to go home by Wednesday’s boat,
what then, young man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener shook his head. “You won’t, I
know,” he said. “You are too reasonable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Reason be blowed,” said Mrs. Rust with spirit.
“You don’t know me very well, young man, if you
think I’m like all the other old cats, to be persuaded
by that sort of argument.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>The gardener was now an expert at saving Mrs.
Rust from herself. Although she entangled herself
habitually in contradictions, her real mind was
not subtle enough to be well hidden, and to guide her
action into the path of her desire was a matter that
only required a little delicacy. The gardener, being
a gardener, was always ready with tactful guidance
and unseen support in such matters. In this case, he
would have been surprised if you had told him that
his secret desire pointed the same way as Mrs. Rust’s.
He thought he had killed desire. But he was tired
of the Island, and he had by that mail received a
quarterly instalment of his income.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Courtesy,” said Mrs. Rust, “we sail for home
next Wednesday. Unreasonable—indeed. And
none the worse for that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have engaged the car for a week from Friday,”
said Courtesy. “Mr. Wise is lunching with
us on Thursday. And the hotel insists on a week’s
notice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am paying you two hundred a year,” said Mrs.
Rust brutally, “to save me from these vulgar details.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Lor’,” said Courtesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what about Scottie?” asked the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Scottie’s your affair, not mine. I’m not paying
you £200 a year to follow me about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener is a very difficult person to snub.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Scottie and I are coming gratis.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Mrs. Rust said, “Good.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>But the little boat, with the suffragette on board of
her, fled across the Atlantic, as if aware of the projected
pursuit of the great mail steamer.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette, a morose unit on a desert island
of her own making, stood separated from the world
by a gulf of gossip. She used to sit on the poop,
where nobody else would sit, with the wind in
her hair and the sun in her eyes, building theories.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are some people who can never see a little
cloud of fantasy float across the horizon of their
dreams without building a heavy castle in the air
upon it, and bringing it to earth. Whenever the
suffragette thought of the gardener, she broke the
thought with a theory. It is sad to be burdened with
a brain that must always track illusion to disillusionment.
She had one consolation, one persistent and
glorious contradiction, one shining truth in a welter of
self-questioning:—“I’m alone—I’m alone—I’m
alone....”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not until they had passed the Azores that
a voice from the outer world spoke to her. They
had reached those islands late one moonlit night.
The little square houses, climbing up the hill-side in
orderly ranks, looked like silver bricks in a castle of
dreams. There was a white fringe of breaking
waves threaded between the black sea and the black
land. From the boats that hurried between the
shore and the steamer, little lamps swung and thin
voices cut the darkness. Thundering silence seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>to invade the emptiness left by the ceasing of the propeller.
The ceaseless loom that always sang behind
the turmoil of the suffragette’s consciousness spun the
moon into a quiet melody. The still lap of the sea
against the ship’s stern struck the ear like a word
never spoken before. You could hear the gods creating
new things. You could hear the tread of the
stars across the sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry to disturb you,” said Miss Brown;
“it’s Albert. I knew something would come of his
going to the fancy-dress dance as Galileo, with such a
thin tunic on; but he is so wilful. And now he has a
high temperature, and a worse pain in his side than
ever. He is crying for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a strange sensation for the suffragette, after
all these days of loneliness, to be cried for. Tears,
like all things that belong to women, appealed to her
beyond words.</p>

<p class='c009'>She found Albert beating on the wall of his cabin.
When he cried—it hurt. When he breathed—it
hurt. When he moved—it hurt. And yet he had
to cry and pant and struggle. There was something
in the suffragette’s plain and ordinary face that acted
as an antidote to Albert’s hectic personality. She
was a poor nurse; her only experience of the sick-room
had been from her own sick-bed. But she had
a cold hand, an imagination which she only allowed
to escape at a crisis, and nerves very difficult to excite.
All that night, while the ship climbed the steep
seas of the Bay, she and the doctor kept something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>that was very big from invading the little cabin.
The battle was, of course, a losing one. There is
something almost funny in the futility of fighting
Heaven on an issue like this.</p>

<p class='c009'>I said there should be no death-bed scenes in this
book, so I will only add that after much battling
Albert managed at last to get to sleep, and he died
before he woke.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette was there, but she was not needed.
She went away and cried because no one would ever
cry for her again.</p>

<p class='c009'>She marconied for Miss Brown’s brother to meet
the bereaved aunt at Southampton. And when the
boat reached home, she carried her mustard-coloured
portmanteau up the gangway, and, by disappearing,
closed the incident.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this wonderful age we do our disappearing by
machinery. Fairy godmothers prefer Rolls-Royce
cars to broomsticks, the pirate employs a submarine
instead of a gallant three-decker, the black sheep of
the piece, instead of donning a mask and confining
the rest of his career to Maidenhead Thicket, books
his passage to a Transatlantic sheepfold on a thirty-knot
liner.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette disappeared by the London train.
By travelling third, she hoped to escape the majority
of her fellow-passengers, and it was not until the
train began to leave the station that she identified a
hitherto unnoticed person opposite to her as the
priest.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>The priest was always overcome by a feeling of
virtue when he travelled third.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So our modesty is mutual,” he said jovially to
the suffragette. “Yerce, yerce, in England I travel
third on principle. My parish, you know, is in a
poor part of London, and I think a shepherd should
as far as possible share the circumstances of his
flock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette hovered for a moment over a very
crude flower of repartee dealing with cattle-trucks,
but discarded the idea. She was always cautious,
when she allowed herself time for caution. Her
principle in conversation was, “When in doubt—don’t.”
But being a militant suffragette, she was
seldom in doubt.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest was aggrieved with the suffragette,
partly because he felt obliged to speak to her. He
would have preferred to ignore her, but she had behaved
too well during the last few days. She had
tried as hard to save a life as ever he had tried to
save a soul, and had failed with equal dignity. Inconsistency
annoyed him very much. You must be
one of two things, a sheep or a goat, preferably the
latter until the priest himself had had time to lead
you to the fold. For a confessed goat suddenly to
don wool without any help from him looked very
much like deliberate prevarication. He did not now
know how to classify the suffragette, and not knowing
how to do a thing in which he had specialised was
naturally exasperating.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“You were asking for my advice about the problem
of your future,” he said, leaning confidentially
towards her. “I have been thinking much about
you, and I believe I have solved the problem.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I need hardly say that the suffragette never asked
for advice. When circumstances obliged her to follow
the advisable course, she hid her docility like a
sin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My future always looks after itself, thank you,”
she said in a polite voice, “and so does my past.
It’s old enough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest stiffened for a moment, but when on
the track of a goat he was hard to check. Besides,
the suffragette’s voice was so low and calm that her
words seemed like a mistake, not to be taken
seriously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My idea is that you should join in the glorious
campaign against poverty and sin in the slums,”
he continued. “I assure you that peace lies that
way. My sister once had a love affair with a freethinker;
she lost a great deal of weight at the time,
and became almost hysterical. But she followed my
advice, and now runs several social clubs in connection
with my Church in the Brown Borough, North
London, where the poor may buy cocoa and cake
and listen to discourses by earnest Christian
workers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what does she weigh now?” asked the suffragette,
after a pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is a splendid example of a Christian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>woman,” said the priest, “a woman of unwavering
faith, indefatigable in charitable works.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I shall come down to your parish as an
antidote,” said the suffragette, “the only sort of
Anti I ever could tolerate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Certainly my suffragette is not worthy to be the
heroine of a book. I must apologise for presenting
a nature so undiluted by any of the qualities that go
to make good fiction. A pun, I admit, is the last
straw, but it is unfortunately a straw occasionally
clutched at by erring humanity, though rarely admitted
by the novelist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should not advise you to choose the Brown
Borough for the scene of your endeavour,” said the
priest hurriedly. “There is little scope for workers
unconnected with a church there. I had in my mind
for you the neighbourhood of Southwark, or Walworth,
South London. Much more suitable, yerce,
yerce. The Brown Borough is very unhealthy for
those unaccustomed to London slums.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet your sister gained weight and lost hysteria
there,” said the suffragette maliciously. “I myself
might be said to have room for improvement on
both these points.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I strongly advise you to choose another parish,”
said the priest, bitterly repenting of his zeal. “So
much excellent work has been done in the Brown
Borough that the majority of the people ought by
now to be on the way to find salvation, both in body
and soul.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“That’s why I propose to come as an antidote,”
said the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>The conversation closed itself. They opened
the <cite>Spectator</cite> and <cite>Votes for Women</cite> simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c009'>London provided the sort of weather it reserves
for those who return from sun-blessed lands. It was
a day with rain in the past and rain in the future, but
never rain in the present. The sort of day that
makes you feel glad you thought of bringing your
umbrella, and then sorry to find you left it in the last
bus. The streets looked like wet slates splashed
with tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette kept a lonely flat not far from
Covent Garden, apparently with the object of ensuring
herself the right to exercise a vote when she
should have procured that luxury. For she very
seldom put the flat to the ordinary uses of flats. It
contained a table and two chairs, as a provision
against the unlikely event of its owner’s succumbing
to social weaknesses. It also contained a bed. Curtains
and carpets, and any cooking arrangement more
elaborate than a gas-ring, are not included in the
Theory of the Hair Shirt, the motto of which is, “I
can very well do without.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette deposited the mustard-coloured
portmanteau at this Spartan abode, and went to report
herself to her Society. She was not a famous
suffragette. If I told you her name, you would not
raise your eyebrows and laugh facetiously and say,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“Oh—<em>that</em> maniac....” She was nominally one
of the rank and file, although, being rebellious even
against co-rebels, she seldom acted under orders.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are, broadly speaking, two kinds of workers
in the world, the people who do all the work, and the
people who think they do all the work. The latter
class is generally the busiest, the former never has
time to be busy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Chief Militant Suffragette, who believed that
she held feminism in the hollow of her hand, was a
born leader of women. She was familiar with the
knack of wringing sacrifices from other people. She
was a little lady in a minor key, pale and plaintive,
with short hair, like spun sand. She dressed as
nearly as possible like a man, and affected an eyeglass.
She probably thought that in doing this she
sacrificed enough for the cause of women. She had
safely found a husband before she cut her hair. I
suppose she had sent more women to prison than any
one magistrate in London, but she had never been to
prison herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cause of the Suffrage, while attracting the
finest women in the country, also attracts those
who consider themselves to be the finest. It has an
equal fascination for those who can work but can
never lead and for those who can lead but never
work.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have written to you three times,” said the Chief
M.S. pathetically to the suffragette. “I do think
you might have answered.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“So do I,” admitted the suffragette, “only
that I have been abroad. What did you write to me
about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Abroad?” said the Chief M.S., and raised her
eyebrows. She had none really, but she raised the
place where they should have been. “Abroad?
Enjoying yourself at such a time as this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” asked the suffragette.
“What has happened? Have we got the Vote?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The eyeglass of the Chief M.S. fell out with annoyance.
“Of course not,” she said, “but it’s the
great massed procession and deputation to-morrow,
and I wanted you to help with the North London section.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette loathed processions. She loathed
working or walking with a herd. She would rather
have blown up Westminster Abbey than stewarded
at a meeting. A less honest woman would have flattered
herself that these are the signs of a great and
lonely mind, but the suffragette knew them as the
signs of vanity. And to cure vanity is, of course, the
business of a hair shirt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When have I got to be there? And where?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the eyes of the Chief M.S. punctuality in other
people was the ideal virtue. The moment she named
to her assistants was always an hour before the correct
time, and two hours before the one she chose for
her own appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette had long been a servant of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Society. By an instinctive calculation she managed
to arrive at Little South Lane next day punctually at
the moment when help began to be needed. She collected
some of the native enthusiasts who were adding
fuel to their ardour on the door-steps of neighbouring
public-houses. She quelled the political antagonism
of a bevy of little boys who were vocally
competing with a Great Woman’s preliminary address.
She soothed the objections of the paid banner-bearers,
who had not been led to expect the additional
opposition of a high wind. She eliminated
from the procession as far as possible all suffragists
below the age of four. She lent a moment’s friendly
attention to the reasons why Woman’s Sphere is the
Home, expounded by a hoarse spinster from an upper
window. She courageously approached an
enormous dock-hand, who had snatched a banner
from its rightful bearer, and was waving it with many
oaths.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Might I trouble you for that banner?” said the
suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gentleman’s reply was simple but obscene.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Might I trouble you at once to move out of my
way, and let the procession join up?” said the suffragette
in a red voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gaw-love yer, me gal, I’m comin’ along,” said
the gentleman. “Wot price me for a&nbsp;... suffragette?
You’ll need a few fists, if you git as fur as
the Delta way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>How very rare it is to mistake the staff for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>broken reed. The suffragette recovered herself
quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg your pardon,” she said. “I ought to
have known from your face that you were a sensible
man. How good of you to carry a banner!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The procession, like a snake, reared its head and
moved. In the van a marching song was begun, in
the rear—a ragtime. The police, looking dignified,
but feeling silly, marched in single file on either
flank, and kept an eye on the interests of the traffic.
The one mounted policeman obviously regretted the
prominence of his position, his horse was an anti, and
showed a man-like tendency to argue with its hoofs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette walked between a little woman in
a plush coat with a baby and a person who might
have been a poetess, or a philosopher, or a Low
Church missionary, but was certainly very earnest.
The long brown streets swung by. The flares on the
coster’s barrows anchored to the kerb, danced in the
yellow air. A hum of barbaric voices, and the large
firm pulse of many feet marching, made a background
to the few clear curses and the fewer clearer
blessings from the pavement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish to Gawd my kiddie ’ed been a gel,” said
the little mother beside the suffragette. “Bein’ a
woman—mikes yer proud-like....”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette put her chin up and laughed.
“As a man, your kiddie’ll make you proud. There’s
sure to be something splendid about a man whose
mother was proud to be a woman.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“Men&nbsp;...” said the little mother, with more
alliteration than refinement, “are&nbsp;... brute
beasts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Ere, draw it mild,” said the dock-hand, who was
just in front.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s men, wytin’ for us, somewhere down the
Delta wy now. Wytin’ to mike us yell an’ run,
wytin’ to ’urt us—jus’ becos we was proud to be
women.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Waiting for us?” gasped the poetess. “Why—how
dreadful.... I wasn’t told there would be
any fighting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You might have known there would be,” said
the suffragette. “You can’t assert facts without
fighting for them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The poetess, obviously wishing she had left such
dangerous weapons as facts to themselves, gave a
hoarse giggle, and said, “I declare, I’m quite frightened....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is frightening,” agreed the suffragette. “Not
the bruises, but the stone-wallness of men. I’m always
frightened by opposition that I can’t see
through at all. I am frightened of Delta Street
hooligans. I am also frightened in exactly the same
way by a polite enemy. You go into the law courts,
for instance, and watch those men wearing their wigs
like haloes and their robes like saints’ armour——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do talk nice, miss,” said the little mother.
“I wish you’d come down to the Brown Borough, an’
jaw my young man.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>The suffragette, though a trifle damped, continued,
“It isn’t that their arguments are strong, nobody
minds that, but it’s that they don’t bother to have
any arguments. Just like the hooligans, only in different
words. It’s no more an argument than it is
one between God and Satan. One side is established,
the other doesn’t exist. It makes you see that to-morrow
is never strong enough to fight to-day. It
would take an angel to admit to-morrow as a fact at
all, and unfortunately it’s men we’re up against.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then what’s the good of all this?” asked the
poetess, who was naturally becoming more and more
depressed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, a losing battle’s fine,” said the suffragette.
“I’d rather wear a black eye than a wig, or a crown,
any day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Ear, ’ear,” said the dock-hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wiv Parliament, for instance,” said the little
mother, who was evidently accustomed to fill her
sphere with her voice. “They sits an’ argoos about
Welsh Establishment, an’ all the while I ’ed my little
gel die of underfeeding, becos I wuz carryin’ this one,
and couldn’t get work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thet’s all very well,” said the dock-hand; “but
wot do you expec’? You carn’t expec’ the lawyers to
frow up their wig an’ say the Law’s a Liar. (Not
but wot it ain’t.) You carn’t expec’ the Prime Minister
to tell ’isself ‘There’s Mrs. Smiff’s biby dyin’,
I mus’ go dahn an’ see abaht it.’ (Not but wot it
ain’t ’ard.”)</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“There are lots of things you can’t kill,” said the
suffragette. “But you can always try. Men don’t
try, because impossibility is one of the things they
believe in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You carn’t kill Votes fer Women,” shouted the
little mother, with a burst of enthusiasm. She waved
her baby instead of a banner.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that moment a yelling horror dropped like a
bomb upon the level street. The suffragette saw the
mounted policeman, complete with his horse, fall
sideways, like a toy. She saw a chequered crowd of
perspiring faces come upon her like a breaking wave.
She saw the banners ahead stagger like flowers before
a wind. She saw the poetess fall, and some one
stamp on her shoulder. She saw a man with a fierce-coloured
handkerchief knotted round his throat seize
the little mother’s chin and wrench it up and down, as
he cursed in her face. The suffragette, who never
could be angry in a dignified way, gave a hoarse
croak and snatched his arm. Possibly she felt like
the child Hercules during his interview with the
serpents, but she did not look like that at all. The
man jerked his arm up, the suffragette’s seven stone
went up too. She was waved like a flag. The tears
were shaken out of her eyes. Her feet kicked the
air. And then she alighted against a wall. She
saw a chinless and unshaven face heave into her upper
vision, and a great hand, like black lightning, cleft
the fog. The knuckles of the hand cut like a blunt
knife. In North London we always repeat our arguments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>when we consider them good ones. The suffragette,
who was a person of no muscular ability at
all, gave up hoping for the chance of a retort in kind,
after the third repetition. So the argument went on
undisputed, until the dock-hand perceived it, when it
was successfully overborne.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette picked up her hat. She hated it
because it looked so dirty. She hated her heart because
it felt so sick. She picked up the poetess and
hated her because she was crying. She was crying
herself, but she thought she looked courageously
wrathful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do we do now?” sobbed the poetess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We walk on,” said the suffragette, and took her,
not very gently, by the arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I can’t, I can’t. It may happen again,”
wailed the poetess. “Policeman, can’t I go home?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, miss,” said the policeman, wiping his brow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there are no taxis.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, miss,” said the policeman.</p>

<p class='c009'>You never can tell what strange thing you may do
at a crisis. The poetess slipped a confiding hand
into that of the policeman, and walked meekly by his
side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Murderers&nbsp;...” exclaimed the little mother.
“They might ’ev done biby in. Your ’ead’s bleedin’,
miss. So’s my gum, but I kin swaller that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette felt as if she had been divided in
two. Her militant spirit, clothed in its hair shirt,
seemed to be moving at a height, undaunted, monopolised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>as usual by the splendour of its cause. And
below, very near the dust, a terribly tired woman, a
unit among several hundreds of other terribly tired
women, put one foot before the other along an endless
road.</p>

<p class='c009'>You must stride over a gap here, as the procession
did mentally. For a very long time I don’t
think anybody thought anything except—“How
long, O Lord, how long?”</p>

<p class='c009'>When I am very tired and see the high and
friendly smile of St. Paul’s curved across the sky, I
feel as if I am near home. I always think St. Paul’s
is like a mother to all London, while Westminster
Abbey is like a nun, the bride of heaven, with an infinite
scorn of you and me. St. Paul’s stands at the
top of the hill of difficulty, and after that your feet
walk by themselves down Ludgate Hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a burst of song from all parts of the
procession as it passed that friendly doomed milestone.
The burst was simultaneous, but the song
was too various to be really effective.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Votes for Women,” shouted the little mother.
“I sy, miss, when are you comin’ dahn to the Brown
Borough to ’elp wiv votes for women? We ain’t got
nobody there as kin talk like you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am I coming down?” asked the suffragette, who
had a vague idea that she had said many things, now
forgotten. “I never speak at meetings now. My
brain is always wanting to say the next thing but one,
and my tongue is always saying the thing before last.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>There’s too much to be said about Votes for Women.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Meetin’s...” said the little mother in a voice
of scorn. “Tain’t meetin’s we want. It’s somebody
jus’ to talk ornery, as if they was a friend-like.
Somebody to live up the street—if you unnerstan’
me—an’ drop in, an’ be interested. When my little
gel died, lars’ October, an’ ’ole lot of lidies made enquiries,
an’ got me a few ’alfpence a week to git on
wiv till I could get back to the box-miking. I useter
’ave to go to an orfice an’ answer questions, an’ the
lidy useter sy she was sorry to seem ’quisitive, but she
ses—If some on yer cheat, you mus’ all on yer suffer....
Bless you, I didn’ mind answering questions,
but I was very low then, an’ I useter tike it ’ard
that none o’ them lidies never seemed interested.
Nobody never as’t wot was the nime o’ my little gel
that died, nor ’ow old she was, nor nothink about ’er
pretty wys that she useter ’ave.... ’Tisn’t that
they ain’t kind, but it’s being treated in a crowd-like
as comes ’ard, an’ there’s many feels the sime....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you expect?” asked the poetess, who
was now detached from the policeman. “I am myself
a C.O.S. secretary, so I know something about it.
None of us have time to do more than is really necessary.
And when there’s public money in question—well,
it’s all very well, but one can’t be too careful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When there’s money in question you may be
right, miss,” said the little mother. “But it ain’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>allus a question of money, an’ it seems to me as ’ow,
wiv votes fer women, if some on them suffragettes ’ud
stop talking about women’s wiges at meetin’s, an’
come an’ look at wiges at ’ome, they’d ’it a lot of
women wot thinks now as ’ow votes for women is
only a public thing an’ don’t matter outside Trafalgar
Square. It seems to ’it you ’arder if a person’s
friendly than if they’re heloquent....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something is happening in front,” said the
poetess, looking wildly round for her policeman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The police have turned on us,” said the suffragette.
“They always do in the Strand. Downing
Street gets nervous when we get as near as this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was too true. The police, relieved to be at last
freed from the burden of their false position, were
characteristic of their profession.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I was told I was to walk to the Houses
of Parliament,” said the poetess, finding her quondam
protector’s hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may walk to Jericho, miss,” replied the
policeman with a wit as heavy as his hand. “Only
not more than three in a group, <em>if</em> you please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A great crowd of little groups trickled on to the
Embankment and followed the tide of the river towards
Westminster. There was a moon. I think
the moon is really the heroine of this unheroic book.
Half the blessing of London belongs to the river,
and half the blessing of the river belongs to the
moon. Do you know how beautifully a full moon
bends out of her sky to trail her fingers in the river?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Do you know how faerily she shoots shavings of her
silver under the bridges, and how she makes tender
the blackness of the barges and the shadows of the
little wharves? I always think the moon has in her
quiver of charms a special shaft for the river of
London. She never smiles like that elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was no surprise to Westminster to see the deputation
and procession arrive, albeit in a less neat form
than that in which it started. The police force has
moments of wonderful insight into the psychology
of law-breakers, and in this case it seemed aware that
a procession of women disbanded and told to go home
in the Strand is nevertheless likely to appear sooner
or later in Parliament Square. The great space resounded
to the tramp of the feet of the law. A detachment
of mounted police strove to look unconcerned
in the Whitehall direction. I always think it
is unjust to drag dumb animals into these political
questions. I wonder the S.P.C.A. doesn’t step in.
Imagine the feelings of a grey mare, for instance, on
being called upon to charge into the ranks of a female
deputation to Downing Street.</p>

<p class='c009'>Neither the suffragette nor I are familiar with the
great ways of deputations. We are of the humble
ranks which suffer physical buffetings in the shadow
of St. Stephen’s, while our superiors suffer moral buffetings
in the shadow of the English Constitution.
There is very little sport in being a shuttlecock anyway,
but while the head gets the straight hit, the
feathers feel most the stress of adverse winds.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>The object of the police in a crowd is to keep it
moving. The direction in which it is to move is
never explained to it. Whether you move to the
right or the left you are sure to be wrong in the eyes
of the law. If you weigh seven stone, your tendency
is to move either upwards or downwards. Correctly
speaking, the suffragette never set foot in
Parliament Square for some time after she arrived
there. She was caught in a gust of crowd, and borne
in an unexpected direction. She did not mind which
way she went, but she was human enough to mind
whether her ribs got broken. Even in a good cause,
matters like these touch you personally. The shoulders
of partisans and martyrs, packed closely against
your ribs, feel just as hard as the shoulders of the
less enlightened. The suffragette began to feel a
cold whiteness creeping up from her boots to her
heart. She began to take a series of last looks at the
moon and the spires of the Abbey. She reached the
earth just when she had decided that she had reached
the door-step of Heaven, and found herself cast by
an eddy into a tiny peace. There, in an alcove, was
the Chief M.S., protected by a stout husband. The
Chief M.S., whose hair was too short to have been
dragged down, and whose eyeglass was trembling
on her breast with pleasurable excitement, was looking
cool and peaceful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do look a wreck,” she said brightly to the
suffragette. “I have been wanting to talk to you
about something I want you to do for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>This was such a frequent remark on the lips of
the Chief M.S. that, as a rule, it made no impression
on her followers and acquaintances. But the suffragette
was incredibly tired, and the power of kicking
against pricks was taken from her. She had no
spirit in her except the ghost of her hair shirt theory,
that fiend which croaks—“Go on, go on....”
She made a great effort. She pulled her hat down
on her head, she put her chin up, she wrapped her
cloak of endurance more closely round her. “Talk
on,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, not now, child,” said the Chief M.S.
“Come and see me next Wednesday. I shall be
away for a long week-end after this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed like making an appointment for a hundred
years hence. The suffragette agreed, because
it seemed impossible that she could live so long as
next Wednesday.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that moment the mounted police charged. The
careful husband of the Chief M.S. whisked her away.
The forelegs of a horse entered the suffragette’s alcove.
The safest place in a police charge is under
the noses of the horses. These animals, usually
anxious to preserve neutrality, have mastered the art
of playing upon the fleeing backs of agitators as
gently as the pianist plays upon the keys. I have
had a horse’s hoofs fanning my shoulder-blades for
minutes on end, and yet only suffered from the elbows
of my fellow-fugitives.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette, alone on the strip of pavement between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>the rearing horses and the recoiling crowd,
conceived the sensational idea of charging the
chargers. This is the sort of idea that comes to one
after a five-hour march and a series of street fights.
I have never been drunk with liquor, but I know what
it is to be drunk all the same. The suffragette determined
that those horses should never see her coattails.
She heard a voice shouting, “Women&nbsp;...
women&nbsp;... women&nbsp;...” and on finding it was her
own, added, “Don’t run back—run forward.”
And she flung herself on the breast of the nearest
horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>A foot-policeman caught her on the rebound. She
was not in the least hurt, but he picked her up and
carried her across his shoulder. She hit her fists
against his helmet; it sounded like a drum. It seems
hard to believe, but I assure you that even on that
high though humble perch, she was revelling in the
thought that it concerned nobody but herself that she
was going to prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>My poor heroine, I am afraid, has stepped beyond
the limits of your toleration, but if you look,
you will find I never asked you to admire her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The policeman lowered her, and stood her like a
doll on the steps of the Metropolitan Railway.
That excellent institution, shocked at the doings outside,
had drawn its grill modestly across its entrance,
and its employés, like good lions at the Zoo watching
the rampant behaviour of the public, were gazing
through the bars.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“You’re not the right size for this job, young
woman,” said the policeman.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette’s reply was a further struggle.
The policeman held both her arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You go ’ome,” he said. “The deputation’s
goin’ ’ome now, like a good gel. What’s your station?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A terrible exhaustion drooped like a weight released
upon the suffragette. The only retort that
came to her mind was, “Leicester Square, please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Change at the Embankment,” said a railway official,
and opened eighteen inches of the gate. The
policeman pushed her in. She took her ticket, and
went home as meekly as any Anti.</p>

<p class='c009'>You may be surprised to hear that the suffragette
spent the next day in bed. A day in bed is not, of
course, part of the Hair Shirt Theory, but this was a
Sunday, and Sunday is a day of weakness, though it
seems politer to the Old Testament to call it a day
of relaxation. The suffragette always spent Sunday
as she liked, with the hair shirt doffed and neatly
folded on a chair beside her. She smoked as many
cigarettes as she pleased, instead of the strict two of
ordinary life, she occasionally ate as many as three
large meals, she had been known to invest in nougat.
Sundays were the oases in her desert, and if the gardener
had chanced on one for the scene of one of
his luckless spasms, this story might have been much
prettier. It is very tiring to be yourself with such
ardour as the suffragette employed, and to be somebody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>else for twenty-four hours once a week becomes
almost a necessity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides, she had court plaster on her forehead, and
the publicly court-plastered pose was one that the
suffragette loathed.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the Chief M.S. had had the luck to catch a
painless black eye in the Cause of the Vote, she would
have flaunted it like a flag up and down Piccadilly.
But the husband had been almost too effective. She
had not even broken her eyeglass.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the most striking differences between the
suffragette and the gardener was that the gardener
told himself: “When I die, they will be sorry, and
they will perhaps understand.” But the suffragette
thought: “When I die, nobody except the charwoman
will know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette went to see the Chief M.S. on
Wednesday.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How curious you should come this afternoon,”
said the Chief M.S. “Some one was here asking
for you only this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette hardly ever explained herself.
She did not remind the Chief M.S. that she was there
by appointment. Nor did she ask who had been inquiring
for her. Perhaps she knew.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He asked for your address,” said the Chief M.S.
“But as he was a man, I didn’t give it to him.
He didn’t leave his name, but he asked me to tell you
that your dog was now in the hands of the quarantine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>officials. I attacked him on the suffrage question, as
I always do strange men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did he say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He had nothing to say. I pointed out to him
how ludicrous was the argument that just because a
person wore two tubes on his legs instead of one, he
was competent to rule.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have never heard that argument used,” said
the suffragette soberly. “I didn’t know that even
men——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, you’re as dense as he was,” snapped the
Chief M.S. “Of course they don’t put it like that.
He asked me which M.P. was responsible for the
tubular argument. I saw it was no use going on.
He left his address for me to give you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was it you wanted to see me about?”
asked the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I want—Oh, yes.... Well, I have been
thinking you have done nothing for the Cause lately,
have you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette fingered a sore dint under the
shadow of her hat. “Hardly anything,” she admitted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think the slum districts want working up,” said
the Chief M.S. “Somebody who walked behind
you in the procession said you hobnobbed wonderfully
with the North London women. How would it be
if you were to undertake a series of informal meetings——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“It isn’t meetings they want, they told me so themselves,”
said the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s meetings everybody wants,” retorted the
Chief M.S. “I thought also that you might start a
soup kitchen or a turkey club, or one of those things
that one does start in the slums. You can’t educate
the poor without feeding them, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense!” said the suffragette, who was certainly
no more accommodating as a follower than as
a woman. “I don’t believe the anatomy of the poor
is one bit different from the anatomy of the rich.
And I don’t believe the way to anybody’s soul lies
through their stomach. Only if one is hungry, one
naturally pretends that blind alley is a thoroughfare.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you suggest that the slums should be
worked up, then, may I ask?” said the Chief M.S.
coldly. There is no point in being a born leader, if
the rank and file refuses to behave suitably.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette loathed the wording of this remark,
but kindly refrained from further criticism.
“If you like&nbsp;...” she said, “I’ll try an experiment
on the Brown Borough. I’ll give no meetings
and I’ll give no membership cards, but if you leave
me time I’ll bring as many women to the Cause as
ever did a dozen meetings in Trafalgar Square.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To hear of other people busy always cheered the
Chief M.S.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will have done a good work,” she said
warmly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette went out with those words singing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>in her head. A thing that very seldom happened
to other people’s words in the ears of this self-absorbed
young woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To have done a good work&nbsp;...” she said, on
the top of a west-bound ’bus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To have done a good work.... But if it were
a good work it could never be done. The way of
good work goes on for ever. And that’s why I
swear I’ll do this work till I die....”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was fine to feel busy again. The suffragette
had always liked to have the measure of her day
pressed down and running over, but she had never
yet known the luxury of having enough of what she
liked. In the home—which is Woman’s Sphere—there
is always time to think how little time there is.
Even the career of an incendiary, though hectic,
often fails to give the illusion of persistent industry.
The suffragette was so lost in enthusiasm over the
discovery of a good long road under her feet at last,
that she presently found herself at Kew.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you must drift, there are few places better to
drift to than Kew Gardens. Only if you go there
just when the months have reached the bleak curve
of the hill that runs down into spring, you must know
where to find the best and most secret snowdrops.
The suffragette knew. She was very familiar with
the art of being alone in London.</p>

<p class='c009'>You will perhaps not be surprised to learn that
never once in her life had her leisure meant some one
else’s pleasure. There had never been any one who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>would have been in the least interested to know that
the suffragette had a few hours unbooked. She never
regretted this fact, because she never noticed it.
With the exception of Excursion Agents, I should
think no one ever knew the holiday resorts around
London better than she did. She could enjoy herself
very much indeed sitting seriously on grass,
watching a world dotted with sentimental cockneyism.
It gave her no pang to be one among many
twos.</p>

<p class='c009'>To-day she found the seat that sits forever looking
at the place where the snowdrops should be, and
only really lives when they come out. And when
she got there, it was most annoying, she thought of
the gardener, to the exclusion of everything else.
After several minutes she found that she had been
occupied in committing the address she had been
given to memory.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Number Twenty-one Penny Street. Twenty-one
Penny Street.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I cannot account for the occasional inconsistency of
this woman except by reminding you of a certain well-known
natural phenomenon. Just as a man whose
arm has been amputated may still suffer from a
phantom finger-ache, so a woman who has killed her
heart must, at certain points in her life, feel the pain
of a heart, as if the dead thing turned in its grave.
One of the most tragic things about loss is that it is
never annihilation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is absurd,” thought the suffragette, pulling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>herself together. “I must make a plan of campaign,
as the M.S. Society would say. How am I
going to start?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Brown Borough popularity is a slippery thing to
seize. You must have a handle to grasp it by.</p>

<p class='c009'>A robin appeared, like a fairy, between two snowdrops.
He did not notice the suffragette, nevertheless
he looked self-conscious. He re-arranged a perfectly
neat feather, and glanced at his waistcoat to
see whether its curve was correct. He even tried
to glance over his waistcoat at his feet, but this was
physically impossible. The suffragette loved him
until she realised that he was in love, on which she
wearied of him. A chirrup behind her drew her attention
to the lady in the case.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe I’ll have to get hold of the priest,” said
the suffragette. I have told you that she was devoid
of tact. She never took enough notice of the
world to sulk when the world was unkind, she was
not human enough to quarrel. I have seen her give
great offence to the Chief M.S. by borrowing a
cigarette in the middle of a tempestuous scene of mutual
reproach. She never reviewed the past when
arranging for the future, and this, in human relations,
is a fatal mistake.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had an apple and an oatmeal biscuit in her
bag. In spite of the robin’s sentimental drawbacks,
she shared the biscuit with him and gave him the
apple core. He finished the biscuit, and when about
three-quarters through with the apple core, he remembered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>his affair of the heart. With the laboured
altruism of the man in love, he tore himself
away, and embodied the apple core theme in a little
song, by way of informing the lady. She came, she
began. Looking up with her third mouthful, she
noticed the suffragette. With a hoarse chirp, she
shot over the horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He forgot to warn her,” sighed the suffragette.
“Men <em>are</em> so unimaginative.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gentleman came back and finished the apple
core.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette’s mind, which was rather sleepy,
turned to the occasion when she too had shot away
from destiny, over a blue horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I left Courtesy as an apple core,” she said.
“Men ought to be as good philosophers as robins,
any day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>You and I are getting tired of this scene. And
so was the suffragette. She shook herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must wake up,” she said. “The incident is
closed. I’m glad it’s closed. But I’m very glad it
was once open. By mistake I came alive for a little
while. I don’t believe in God, and I don’t believe in
love. But I thank God I have met love—in a
dream.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She might possibly have been referring to the
robin drama. But I don’t think she was.</p>

<p class='c009'>She put her chin up, and buttoned up the hair shirt,
and exchanged the snowdrops for a ’bus.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>It was the day after this that the priest was addressing
his sister’s Girls’ Club in the Brown
Borough. He was supplying food for the soul while
his sister prepared food for the body. The girls
were listening with the polite though precarious attention
which Brown Borough girls always bring to
bear on the first three hundred words of any address,
especially if the addresser be a man. Factory girls
are amiable creatures with something inborn that
very closely resembles good manners. Unless you
are so unfortunate as to stumble upon their sense of
humour, they will always give you a hearing. Their
sense of humour is broad, but only touched by certain
restricted means. If you have a smut on your
nose, or if your hat is on one side, or if you stammer
in your speech, or if it is obvious that you have just
sat in a puddle on alighting from your ’bus, you need
cherish no hopes, but be sure that every word you say
is only adding to the comedy of the situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest was extremely neat, as usual. His
piercing eyes under his grey hair looked dignified,
and he was concealing moral quack remedies in
gilded anecdotes with marked success. He had
reached the critical point in a comic story about his
recent adventures in the tropics, and was just preparing
to lead the roar of amusement, when, over
the heads of his audience, he saw a face that seemed
terribly familiar. He finished the story with such
gravity that nobody dared to smile.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“How unwise I was to put the idea into her
head,” he told himself, and, descending from his
eminence, went to meet her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is indeed a surprise, yerce, yerce,” he said,
shaking her coldly by the hand. He thought that
she would be cut to the heart by the fact that he
failed to qualify the surprise as pleasant. She did
not notice the omission. She was not accustomed to
being made very welcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have followed your advice,” she said. “I
have come down to ask you for work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How very well-timed,” said the priest’s sister
just behind him. “Christopher, introduce the young
lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will talk of that later,” said the priest. “I
have not finished my address.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But he virtually had. For he could find nothing
else to say, although he continued speaking. The
girls lost interest, and began passing each other letters
and photographs from their chaps. A little
plain girl, beside whom the suffragette had taken her
seat, handed her one of these documents.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have said that the suffragette had a hard face—it
is worth noting that no beggar ever begged of her
unless he was blind. But I suppose she had loved
women so long and so fiercely that there was something
in her look that established confidence in the
women she met. Nobody would have handed a
love-letter to Mrs. Rust to read, within five minutes
of her first appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>“The cocoa is ready, Christopher,” said the
priest’s sister audibly, from an inner room.</p>

<p class='c009'>A remark like this, though trivial, will throw almost
any orator off his track. The priest stopped,
with the resigned sigh of Christian irritation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette handed the letter back to her
neighbour. “What a nice chap yours must be,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you the young woman wot’s come to ply
the pianner?” asked the girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not sure,” replied the suffragette, with a
guarded look at the priest. “I rather think I am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was luckily considered amusing, and over the
cocoa the comments on the new young woman were
favourable.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest’s sister came out from the inner room,
whence proceeded the loud bubbling squeaks of
cocoa-drinkers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Christopher,” she said, “why didn’t you
tell me you had found a new helper?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not know that I have, my dear,” replied the
priest. “This young lady has misinterpreted something
I said to her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s very lucky that she did, then,” said the
priest’s sister. “We are so badly in need of a new
voluntary helper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You oblige me to put the matter baldly, my
dear,” said the priest, keeping his temper with a
creditable effort. “This is the young lady I mentioned
to you last night in the course of conversation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>All our helpers hitherto have been of the highest
moral character.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“From your face...” said the priest’s sister to
the suffragette. “I am sure you mean well. I am
sure you are not wicked. And if you have slipped,
there is nothing like hard work in the Brown
Borough to make you forget.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette was so much startled to hear herself
addressed in this unusual vein that she very
nearly cried. It is rare to have tears so near so
horny a surface as hers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear&nbsp;...” said the priest. “I think you
forget my position of authority in this parish. You
also forget the pure young souls committed to your
care in this club. Yerce, yerce.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He actually imagined the factory girls to be as
innocent as himself. To him the words youth and
innocence were indivisible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, nonsense, Christopher,” said his sister.
“She doesn’t necessarily want to help with this club,
and even if she did she can’t convey infection to the
girls by playing the piano to them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not expect she does play the piano,” said
the priest lamely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do play, don’t you? You have such pretty
hands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After that, of course, the suffragette felt as though
she could have played Strauss to please her. As a
matter of fact she had little real articulate gift for
music, but she never forgot a tune she had heard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>and found no difficulty in rendering the songs that
always sang in her head, outwardly instead of inwardly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest’s sister was not musical. Nor was she
critical. She considered that the Brown Borough
had in this newcomer found something it had lacked.
The suffragette, who possessed certain secret springs
of conceit, was to some extent of the same opinion.
And by the end of the evening the majority of the
girls shared this view.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know a Mrs. Smith?” asked the suffragette,
as she said good-bye.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know perhaps five hundred Mrs. Smiths,” said
the priest’s sister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She wears a plush coat, and a baby, and a little
girl of hers died in October.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“About two hundred and fifty out of the five hundred
wear plush coats, and babies, and little girls
that die.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder what surnames are for,” said the suffragette
pettishly, “since they have ceased to distinguish
one person from another?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you come to me to-morrow,” said the priest’s
sister, “I will give you the names of various women
who want visiting. If your Mrs. Smith needs you,
you will soon find her, if you live in the Brown
Borough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette was a rash woman. She always
abode by her own first choice. Before she went to
see the priest’s sister in the morning, she found herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>a Brown Borough lodging. She did this by the
simple device of knocking on the door of the first
house she saw that displayed a notice, “Apartment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now then, wot’s the matter?” asked the lady
who opened the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette, though impossible to silence, was
easy to abash. And there is certainly something disheartening
in such a salutation. However, she suggested
that the notice in the window might excuse an
intrusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was very lucky; one always is when one
doesn’t deserve to be so. She might have found a
room with a brown wet ceiling curtseying floorward
under the stress of many rains. She might have
found a room peopled by a smell incredible, with rags
stuffed into panes that had been broken by a merciful
accident. She might have found walls discoloured
by dark patches that looked like old blood. All these
things are apt to decorate Woman’s Sphere in the
Brown Borough.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the suffragette had, by mistake, knocked on
the door of the most respectable house in the most
respectable street in the district. She found a clean,
though dark room, with a window blinking against
the sun at a back yard filled with snowdrops. The
wall-paper talked in a loud voice of tulips: wine-coloured
tulips trampled on each other and wrestled
for supremacy over every inch of it. The tablecloth
and carpet were the colour of terra-cotta, and
firmly disagreed with every word the wall-paper said.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Two horse-hair chairs, in sullen brown, looked moodily
at each other across the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette never asked more than that her
body might live in a clean place. She kept her mind
detachable from colour schemes. After all, what is
my body for but to enclose me?</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll have the room,” said the suffragette, as if it
had been a cake of soap.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was like a dream to the landlady, a dream she
had never been sufficiently feverish to indulge in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll have it?” she gasped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. Why not? What’s the rent, by the
way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The landlady, by means of a rapid mental process
of multiplication, rose manfully to the occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, fifteen shillings,” said the suffragette.
“I’ll come in to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She went to see the priest’s sister, but to her mild
annoyance found the priest instead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My sister suggested that you should visit the
Wigskys,” said the priest, who never bore malice, as
far as one could see. He never allowed you for a
moment to forget that he was a Christian. “Mrs.
Wigsky’s latest baby hasn’t been christened. Also I
think the eldest girl must be getting into bad ways;
she has left the excellent place I found for her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And must I persuade the baby to be christened?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not the child itself. You had better do your
best to persuade the mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>“But supposing she refuses on principle?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest fixed her with his piercing eye.
“There can be no principle contrary to the Right,”
he said. “The opposite to Right is Wrong.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How simple!” said the suffragette. “But
won’t Hell be terribly overcrowded?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest sighed, and certainly with reason.
But he remembered that he was very broad-minded,
and that he had often said that everybody had a right
to their own opinion. He remembered that the soft
answer that turneth away the fatuity of women had
found a place even in the New Testament.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one would be more loth than I&nbsp;...” he
said, “to classify as condemned all whose views do
not coincide with the dictates of the Church. Let us
rather call them mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette shut in a renewed protest with a
snap of her jaws. Although she badly needed a
handle by which to seize the Brown Borough, surely
there must be other handles than the Church. She
determined secretly on determination as her unaided
weapon.</p>

<p class='c009'>But she went to see the Wigskys. She found
them—a large family, red and mutually wrathful in
an atmosphere of hot smells ancient and modern.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she got inside the door she wondered why
she had come. The baby screaming on its mother’s
breast looked incorrigibly heathen, the eldest girl
looked wholly unsuited to any “excellent place” discovered
by the priest.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>“Wooder <em>you</em> want?” asked the harassed mother,
a drab and dusty creature, with the used look of
cold ashes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve come from Father Christopher&nbsp;...” began
the suffragette, wishing she had come from some
one else.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’N you can go back to Farver Christopher,”
said Mrs. Wigsky. “Becos I ain’t goin’ to ’ave
no more bibies christened. It’s ’eaven ’ere, an’
’eaven there, this biby’s goin’ ter grow up ’eeven fer
a chinge. It carn’t get us into worse trouble nor
wot we’ve ’ad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t come to bother you,” said the suffragette.
“After all, it’s your baby, not Father Christopher’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s wot I ses,” said the mother, slightly mollified.
“Well, if you ’aven’t come abaht Biby, wot
’ave you come for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve come because I want to find friends in the
Brown Borough. If you don’t want me, please tell
me to go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Brown Borough never protests if you surprise
it; and in any case, Mrs. Wigsky’s soul was too
dead for consistent protest. Also it was certainly
a change to be visited by one who lacked the visitor’s
apprising eye, who seemed unaware of an unswept
floor and an unmade bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As Father Christopher talked about the Brown
Borough women&nbsp;...” said the suffragette, “I
wanted more and more to know them, because it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>seems to me so splendid to keep going at all in the
Brown Borough. I must tell you I always love
women. So you must forgive me for coming.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Tain’t often as lidies come to admire us,” said
Mrs. Wigsky. “They allus comes to show us ’ow
wrong we are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not a lady,” said the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ow, yus you are,” said the eldest girl, speaking
for the first time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you the girl that’s out of a job?” asked the
suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yus. Farver Christopher got me a job as general
to the lidy oo keeps the post orfice. She give
me three-an’-six a week an’ no food, an’ mother ain’t
earnin’ now, an’ Tom’s in ’orsbital, so it weren’t
good enough. I run awiy. She ’it me too, an’ mide
me cerry up the coals. But ’er bein’ a lidy, I couldn’t
siy much—I jus’ run awiy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you’d hit her back,” said the suffragette.
“And I wish the word ‘lady’ had never been invented.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lidies is lidies, an’ generals is generals,” said
Mrs. Wigsky. “Gawd mide it so, an’ you carn’t
get over it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure God never made it so,” said the suffragette.
“He made men and women, and nothing
else. He made man in His own image, and left
woman to make herself. And she’s doing it.
That’s what makes us all so proud to be women.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not proud of bein’ a woman. I’m sick of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>it,” said Mrs. Wigsky; but the girl said, “You do
talk beautiful, miss. I b’leeve I’m a little bit proud.
Anywiy, I wouldn’t be a man for somefink.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Men,” sniffed Mrs. Wigsky. “It’s men wot
does all the ’arm. An’ yet you carn’ get along wivout
’em altogether. They’re so ’elpless.”</p>

<p class='c009'>(I hope you notice this truth, one of the few unposed
truths in this book. Man is potentially a son,
and woman is potentially a mother; woman depends
on the dependence of man. The spinster, if pathetic
at all, is pathetic because she has no one to look
after, not because there is no one to look after her.
Bear in mind that the conventional spinster keeps a
canary as a substitute for a husband.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“All the same,” said the suffragette, “men are
proud of being men, and that is one of the greatest
virtues. I don’t suppose there is a man in London
who would be general to a Post Office lady at three-and-six
a week and no food.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was thought to be supremely witty, and the
suffragette rose to depart on the crest of a ripple of
popularity. The girl followed her half-way downstairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You fink that I was roight then to chuck that
job, miss?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette at that moment parted company
with Father Christopher.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly I think you were right. It’s very
wrong to take less money than you’re worth. I’d
rather lend your mother money to get on with until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>you can get a worth-while job than let a friend of
mine go so cheap as three-and-six a week. You can
give your mother this address, and tell her I’ll come
to see her again very soon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As she reached the first landing, she became aware
of a fresh twist in the maze. I think drama of a
rather sombre variety is the very life of the Brown
Borough, and I defy you to thread its streets or
climb its stairways for half a day without meeting
some Thing you never met before.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doorway on the first landing was practically
filled by a woman, whose most surprising characteristic
was that her right eye was filled with blood.
The blood was running down on to the breast of her
dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m feelin’ that queer,” said the woman. “It’s
the sight o’ blood allus mikes me queer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must let me help you,” said the suffragette.
“You must let me put you on your bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman laughed and remained swaying in the
doorway.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bedder standen’&nbsp;...” she mumbled hysterically.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was an enormous woman, and effectually
blocked the doorway. For one mad moment the
suffragette meditated climbing over her. An obstacle
always had an irresistible fascination for her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be so silly,” said the suffragette. “Let
me come in at once. I am here to help. Stand
aside.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman laughed again, and her head suddenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>lolled down upon her breast. A little drip
of blood ran down upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are making a mess on the floor,” said the
suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a magic in the words. I suppose their
power lay in their utter futility. The woman stood
aside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now let me get you to bed,” said the suffragette
as she entered. But there was no bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were a dresser, a small table, and a chair.
There was also a man, noisily asleep upon the
chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ran me eye agin the corner of the tible,” said
the woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How very unlucky,” said the suffragette, “considering
the table’s practically the only thing in the
room. Except the man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She took the back of the chair and tipped it forward.
She tilted it to such an angle that nobody
in their senses could have remained seated in it.
But a guardian angel seems to look after the drunk
at the expense of the sober. When because she was
not a professional weight-lifter, the suffragette had
to let the chair revert to its natural position, the man
was still comfortably asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman fainted in the corner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wake up, you damned pig!” said the suffragette,
with the utmost strength of her soft voice,
and she struck his shoulder with all the weight of a
perfectly useless fist.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>“Shall I fetch a policeman?” asked Miss Wigsky.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Law’s no good,” said the suffragette frowning.
“I don’t believe there is a law against a man
being drunk in the only chair. Do you think you
could borrow a cushion or two from your mother,
so that we could make the woman comfy on the
floor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time Miss Wigsky returned with the relic
of a pillow, the suffragette had bathed the blood
from the eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Woz this?” inquired the woman, opening the
surviving eye upon the appearance of Miss Wigsky.
“Woz this? Pillers? Tike ’em awiy. I
’aven’t bin to bed in the diytime for twenty years,
nor I ain’t goin’ to begin now....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must lie down,” said the suffragette.
“And I will fetch the doctor to sew up your
eye.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bless yer&nbsp;...” crowed the invalid. “S’long
as I’ve got legs to walk to the doctor on, you kin
bet yer life ’e won’t walk to me. I’ll go’n see ’im,
soon’s as I stop bein’ all of a tremble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll come with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As you please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Wigsky escaped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why do you allow that man to be drunk in
here?” asked the suffragette after a pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’E don’t arsk my leave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is he your husband?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“No. ’E is in a manner of speakin’. But I
wouldn’t really marry a soppy bloke like thet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then why do you have soppy blokes crowding
you out of your own furniture?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ow, one must ’ave a man about the plice.
Feels more ’omely-like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does he work for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t fink.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is he very good to you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman, not unnaturally, began to get restive.
“’Oo ye’re gettin’ at? Nat’rally a man ain’t
soothin’ syrup when ’e come ’ome as my young
man come ’ome an hour ago. ’E’s better’n
some.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a long silence. Then the suffragette
said, “Women seem to be extraordinarily cheap in
the market. They hire themselves out to the man
who hits the hardest. It makes one almost tired of
being a woman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look ’ere&nbsp;...” said the patient wrathfully, but
she stopped there. Presently she sat up and said,
“I’m goin’ to doctor’s now. And if you ain’t still
too <em>tired</em>, miss, perhaps you’ll see me as fur as the
’orspital....”</p>

<p class='c009'>So the suffragette laid hold of the Closed Door
of the Brown Borough, by the handle of her fanatic
determination. She never saw the impossibility of
victory. It was the earliest of the early spring, and
there was hope in the air. For many weeks hope
was her only luxury. With it she sweetened her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>bread and margarine when she rose, to the tune of
it she munched her nightly tripe and onions. She
saw the mirage of the end in sight, and with her great
faith she almost made it real. She was a blind
optimist where women were concerned.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the initiative of the priest’s sister, she attended
the Church Girls’ Club three evenings a week. On
her own initiative she played the Church false, and
established in its own field of labour, behind its back,
the foundation of her task.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was originally Miss Wigsky’s fault. Miss
Wigsky was a girl of practical energy, a warring
spirit, a potential suffragette. She had long been a
militant resister of the Church Club ideal, but when
the suffragette became one of its regular adherents,
Miss Wigsky joined it at once. Hers was the active
responsibility for what followed, and ’Tilda’s the
passive. I think I have mentioned ’Tilda before,
though not by name. She was a small white creature
who had committed the absurdity of losing her
heart to the suffragette at first sight, and had sealed
her admiration by laying bare the letter of her chap
at their first meeting.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moment of cocoa-drinking was always the
moment of confidences. It was during this comparatively
peaceful time that the suffragette made
friends, and it was at this point that ’Tilda one evening
approached her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jenny Wigsky’s a funny gel,” said ’Tilda.
“She’s bin talkin’ about you, miss. I got a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>job the other day, very little money—piece-work—on’y
shillin’ a diy if I work ever so ’ard. I ses to
Jenny, ‘I’m a good gel I am, to tike less money than
I’m worth just to ’elp my muvver.’ But Jenny ses
I’m a very bad gel—she ses you ses as it’s wicked
to tike bad money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t say it was wicked—I wouldn’t use the
word,” said the suffragette. “But I do think it’s
selfish. Every time a girl takes too little money,
she may be forcing another girl to take less. You
know it’s partly your fault that women’s wages are
so bad. You can feel now that you’ve had a share
in the work of sweating women, ’Tilda.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t I tell you?” said Miss Wigsky. “Why
don’t you do as I do, an’ stick out for ten?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you’re not gettin’ it,” objected ’Tilda.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m goin’ to get it, I am. I’m goin’ back to my
ol’ tride—box-miking. I left it becos the work
was so ’ard, but the money’s better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t mind how hard people work, as long as
they get paid for it,” said the suffragette. “Of
course, you have to do good work for good money.
What I mean is that I think it’s just as dishonest to
take too little money as it is to do too little
work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But wot’s the good of one standin’ out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very little good. But more good in a dozen
standing out and more still in a hundred.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Le’s start a sassiety,” suggested the strenuous
Miss Wigsky. “You could be the Preserdink, miss,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>an’ I’ll ’elp yer. We’ll call ourselves the ‘Suffragette
Gels,’ an’ we won’t allow none of us to tike
less money than ten shillin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Garn&nbsp;...” said ’Tilda. “Thet’s a Tride Union,
thet is. A man’s gime. If I chuck my job,
’oo’s goin’ to keep me til I get a better one. Muvver?
I don’t fink....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will,” said the suffragette. “If there’s anybody
here earning less than ten shillings a week,
I’ll give them seven-and-six a week for a fortnight
if they have to chuck their job, and I’ll also give a
prize of seven-and-six at the end of the fortnight to
the girl who’s increased her wages the most.”</p>

<p class='c009'>No plan could ever have been less planned. She
thought of it as she spoke of it, a most rash method.
But Miss Wigsky immediately set to work to hew
it into shape.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll ’ave to arringe for piece-work, miss,” she
said. “Anybody on piece-work could increase their
wiges by working for twenty-four hours a diy, but it
wouldn’t be fair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nobody must work after eight at night,” said
the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ if two or three gets the sime rise?” suggested
Miss Wigsky.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll give them each seven-and-six,” said the
suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the twenty girls present, three were earning
over ten shillings and entered a different class of the
competition, working for the prize without the maintenance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>if a rise should be found possible without
loss of employment. Of the remaining seventeen,
two refused to compete, and one was too small to be
worth more than her present earnings. The other
fourteen determined on an immediate attack on their
employers. Chances were discussed instead of
dances for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My boss’ll siy—the money’s there—you kin
tike it or leave it. ’E’s said that before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My boss’ll smile—’e allus calls me ’Tip-a-wink,
becos I’m the smallest gel there. ’E’s never cross—my
boss ain’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I’ll win the prize easy—don’t know why
I never thought of it before. Buster—my boss—ses
I’ve got the ’andiest ’ands wiv the bristles as ever
’e see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My missus’ll siy—there’s ’undreds of sluts in
the Borough twice as good as you, an’ I like yer imperence,
an’ you kin tike the sack wivout notice.
She allus calls me a slut—we won’t be sorry to
part.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall stick to the fevver work, an’ tike up
curlin’ an’ sewin’, as well as the knotting. I bin
too lizy up to now, but I’ve got an aunt in the tride
as ’ud learn me in no time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At closing time the priest drew the suffragette
aside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I heard Jane Wigsky’s voice constantly raised
in the dining-room this evening. I want your opinion
of that girl. Yerce, yerce. She seems to me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>rough and coarse, and I am tempted to think she is
a disturbing influence in the Club.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s not so disturbing as I am,” said the suffragette,
with a spasm of conscience.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, don’t say that,” said the priest, whose sister
had been readjusting his manners. “Don’t be
disheartened, you will soon get into our ways, yerce,
yerce. But to return to Jane Wigsky, I do not like
the girl. She is impertinent and self-assured. I
feel sure she puts ideas into the girls’ heads.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shouldn’t think an idea more or less would
make much difference.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest sighed. I am not surprised. I quite
admit that the suffragette was an infuriating person.
I yield to none in my admiration for any one who
could manage to keep their temper with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know I mean harmful ideas. She has no
staying power. She left excellent employment, apparently
simply through a whim. Her mistress, the
postmistress, is a great friend of mine. In short, I
consider the girl undesirable, and we are thinking of
asking her to leave the Club.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette became red.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry the postmistress is a friend of yours,”
she said. “Because she can’t be a very admirable
friend. She herself admits that she only paid the
girl three-and-six a week, with no food except a cup
of tea at mid-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor wages, yerce, yerce. But far better than
idleness.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“Infinitely worse,” said the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>A rather feverish silence fell for a moment. I
think the priest said a prayer. At any rate he
thought he did.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely you have some sympathy with our aims
in this Club. Surely you agree that it is a worthy
ideal to try to raise the level of the young womanhood
of the Borough. Surely you see that we cannot
do this unless we keep the girls in good uplifting
company. Jane Wigsky is a bad girl. One must
draw the line between good and bad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One may draw a line, but one needn’t build a
barrier. And even to draw a line, one should have
very good sight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I hardly need your advice on the
management of a parish I have served for twenty-two
years. If this were my Club I should request
you to find some other outlet for your energies.
But my sister is very obstinate. Good
evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A certain amount of success attended the efforts
of the Suffragette Girls. By the end of that week,
three girls had been given a rise for the asking, the
extent of it varying from sixpence to two shillings.
Several had got a promise of a rise when work
should be less slack, only three had taken the drastic
step of leaving their employment. The piece-workers
with few exceptions were working for a wage
which seemed unalterable. An envelope-folder
raised her earnings from three halfpence a thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>to twopence. But as a rule there is no labour groove
so deep as the piece-worker’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was on the Thursday night before Good
Friday that the suffragette, dressed in a dressing-gown,
sat before her fire remembering the simplest
character in this simple book—Scottie
Brown.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s dog-stealing,” she thought, “no less. Miss
Brown may return to the Island any time crying out
for Scottie to come and comfort her. And Scottie
will be languishing in England, undergoing quarantine.
We are dog-thieves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The “we” sent a little heat-wave over the place
where her heart should have been.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had been working very hard all day, walking
about the Brown Borough collecting its worries.
She was so tired that she could not rest, could not
go to bed, could not do anything except sit on her
hearthrug and think feverishly of things that did not
matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Outwardly the suffragette, when in her dressing-gown,
and with her hair drawn into a small smooth
plait, approached more nearly her vocation than under
any other circumstances. She was a nun, dedicated
to an unknown God.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A person to see you,” said the landlady, and
flung open the door. The suffragette shot to her
feet, with a momentary terrible suspicion that the
landlady had said “parson.” Visions of a bashful
curate brought face to face with a militant suffragette
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>in her dressing-gown, were, however, swept
away by the entrance of Miss Wigsky.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a —— shime,” remarked the visitor loudly,
discarding the convention of greeting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure to be,” said the suffragette, sinking down
upon the hearthrug again. “Nearly everything’s
that kind of shame. Sit down and tell me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tol’ you I’d got a job, you know, at Smiff’s—boot-uppers.
A lucky find it were, I thought, ten
shillin’ a week an’ I was to be learnt ’ow to work
a machine. ’E ses ’e thought I was a likely sort on
Monday when I went, but ’e ses as ’e was goin’ to
learn me somethink, an’ ’e wanted a special sort of
gel, like, ’e ars’t for references. Knowin’ as ’e was
a religious sort of gentleman, an’ give ’eaps of money
to the Church, I tol’ ’im Farver Christopher for my
reference, because Farver Christopher’s known
Muvver sence she married, an’ allus said ’e would
’elp ’er whenever ’e could. So when I went agine
yesterday, to Smiff’s, ’e ses as ’ow Farver Christopher
’adn’t spoke well of me—said I was unreliable,
an’ never stuck to one job. So Mr. Smiff ses
in thet cise I wouldn’t suit, but ’e ses as I looked likely
’e’d give me a job as packer at six shillin’. I ses as
I couldn’ afford to tike so little money, an’ I tol’ ’im
about you an’ the Suffragette Gels. ’E ses you
oughter be ashimed of yoursel’, an’ ’e’d write an’
tell Farver Christopher as ’ow ’is Club was an ’otbed
of somethink or other. I ’ites Farver Christopher—curse
’im—an’ ’e miking belief to be so ’elpful.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>I was in my first job free years, an’ jus’ because I
chucked the —— job ’e found for me, ’e does me
dirty like this. Curse ’im.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t,” said the suffragette. “Suffragettes
don’t waste breath in cursing—even when there
seems to be nothing to do but curse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This evenin’&nbsp;...” continued Miss Wigsky, “I
went to the Club to see if you was there, though it
wasn’t your night. Farver Christopher turned me
out, ’e did. ’E’s turned out fifteen of the gels, an’
tol’ them never to come back no more. ’E found out
from the others which was the suffragette gels, an’
turned ’em out. I stood up to ’im, and arsk’ ’im
wotever we’ve done that’s wrong, there ain’t no ’arm,
I ses, in tryin’ to get a livin’ wige. I arsk’ ’im ’ow
’e’d like to live under seven shillin’ a week. ’E ses
as ’ow God ’ad called us to this stite of life, an’ it
was wicked to try an’ alter it. ’E ses as women are
pide what they’re worth, an’ God mide rich an’ poor
an’ men an’ women, an’ never meant the poor to be
rich, or women to be pretending they was as good
as men&nbsp;... I spit at ’im, miss, I ’ope you’ll excuse
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll excuse you,” said the suffragette, “though
I don’t think it was a very artistic protest. I am
most awfully sorry for you, Jenny, but I’m not surprised.
For you know when you became a suffragette
you agreed to fight, and now you’ve found out
what you’re fighting, that’s all. Suffragettes are just
soldiers—only more sober—and when they meet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>the enemy, they just get more determined, not more
excited. If you were a soldier and got wounded,
we should be sorry for you, but also rather proud of
you. We must collect the suffragette girls somewhere
else, and make the army grow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe you can, miss. I went to see
’Tilda, an’ she was pretty near soppy about it. She’s
piece-work, an’ carn’ get ’er boss to rise ’er, so she
ain’t done nothink to be turned out of the Club for,
she ses. She ses as ’ow she won’t never ’ave nuffink
more to do wiv them suffragettes. Then I met Lil,
the tow-’aired gel—she was drunk—at the corner
of the Delta. She puts it all on you, miss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you feel like that?” asked the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ow well, in a manner o’ speakin’, it wouldn’
’ave ’appened if it ’adn’t bin for you, miss. But I
don’t feel sore against you, not really. You did it
for the best. You miy be right about fightin’ the
enemy, on’y the enemy’s too strong. P’r’aps Farver
Christopher’s right, an’ God mide women to starve
till they marry, an’ get beaten till they die....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If there is a God,” said the suffragette in a low
voice, “the only possible conclusion is that he is an
Anti. Still, even a God can be fought.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ow, I’m sick o’ fightin’,” said Miss Wigsky.
“I shall go orf wiv my chap, though ’e is out of
work....”</p>

<p class='c008'>The gardener was at 21 Penny Street, waiting for
an answer to his message. To pass the time he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>found work, or rather work had found him, for he
was a man of luck. Eventually, instead of an answer,
Mrs. Paul Rust called on him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How’s your son?” asked the gardener, who
was pleased to meet some one who had met the
suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beneath his superficial “unscathed” pose, there
was a layer of deep faithfulness. He knew by now
that the suffragette was not worthy of the love of a
sober Assistant Secretary to a Society Which Believed
Itself of Great Importance (one of his
latest practical poses). But the thing one knows
makes no difference to the thing one feels, if
one is young. The gardener was under the impression
that his wisdom had dethroned the suffragette
from her eminence, but his heart, with
the obstinacy peculiar to hearts, continued to look
up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My son is bad. He gets no stronger. There
is no reason why he shouldn’t get up, except that he
isn’t strong enough to walk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not,” said Mrs. Rust automatically, and
stood checked by such a decided lie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What annoys me is Courtesy,” she said after
a pause. “Courtesy indeed, she hasn’t treated me
fairly. She had the impertinence to tell me last week
that she was engaged to that ridiculous young Wise
she picked up at Greyville. Engaged indeed, it’s
stuff and nonsense, pure defiance. She’s treated me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>as a sort of matrimonial agent. I wasn’t paying her
£200 a year to look for a husband.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” agreed the gardener. “Then why don’t
you forbid the banns?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Mrs. Rust’s helplessness in the hands of
Courtesy rose vaguely to her memory. “Stuff and
nonsense,” she said. “I haven’t yet decided what
steps I shall take in the matter. There is no immediate
hurry. She has suggested letting the matter
drop until Samuel is better. She has many failings,
but I think she is fond of me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a very attractive failing,” admitted the
gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t come here to discuss Courtesy with
you,” snapped Mrs. Rust, suddenly remembering
her temper. “I came because Samuel wanted me
to come. He seems to be under delusions about you,
he thinks he owes you gratitude. In fact—probably
under the influence of delirium—he once said
you financed his hotel. As a matter of fact I
financed it myself, it owes its present success to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s awfully good of you to come all this way
to bring me misdirected gratitude,” said the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stuff and nonsense,” said Mrs. Rust. “I
wouldn’t stir an inch out of my way to make you
more conceited than you are. But that is the worst
of having a son, you have to pay occasional attention
to his wishes. Besides, Courtesy brought me up
to town and gave the address to the chauffeur, so I
really wasn’t consulted. Samuel wishes to see you.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>All the time he was ill he was asking for the Tra-la-la
young man, and now I find he means you. I might
have said that right at the beginning, and not have
wasted all this time listening to your chatter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m very glad you didn’t,” said the gardener.
“I couldn’t bear a caller who came straight to the
point in five words and then left.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stuff and nonsense,” said Mrs. Rust. “Are you
coming?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was half-past three on Good Friday afternoon.
There is something about that little Easter cluster
of Sundays that weighs your heart down, if you are
in postless London, and expecting a letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is your son?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In Hampshire, in the Cottage Hospital, near
the Red Place. You could put up at the Red Place.
Samuel, being a fool, said you might have the big
black and white room on the first floor. He might
have let it for five guineas over Bank Holiday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What time is the train?” asked the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My car is at the door. The chauffeur is a dangerous
lunatic, and there seems to me to be every
likelihood that the back wheel will come off before
we get out of London. But—are you coming?”</p>

<p class='c009'>So the gardener came. Seated behind the dangerous
lunatic, over the dangerous back wheel, and beside
a hostess in a musical comedy motor bonnet, he
followed once more the road that led to the gods.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had left his address with Miss Shakespeare for
the forwarding of letters.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>The great surprise of spring awaited them outside
London. There were lambs under a pale sky, and
violets under pale green hedges. Gnarled trees, like
strong men’s muscles, curved out of roadside copses,
lit with a green radiance. There was lilac smiling
across the cottage gardens, there were wallflowers
blotted dark against whitewashed walls. But when
they reached the pines and heath they left the spring
behind. Only the larches preached its gospel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You had better come and see Samuel first,” said
Mrs. Rust. “He is anxious to see you. He always
was a fool.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they passed the Red Place. It flared out at
them along a sombre ride that cut the woods in two.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Samuel says his gods look after the place as well
as any manager, while he is away. But of course
he has a chef now, and a competent bureau clerk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose you couldn’t ask the gods to dish up
the dinner, or make out the bills,” admitted the gardener
regretfully. “But I wonder if there’s room
for the gods as well as the chef and the competent
bureau clerk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stuff and nonsense,” said Mrs. Rust. “A good
dinner’s worth all the gods in mythology.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They drove up to their destination.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cottage hospital had only recruited to the
service of the sick in later life. For a hundred years
or so it had been the haunt of the wicked landowner.
Worldly squires’ wives had given tea in its paved
pergola to curates’ wives in their best hats. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>as the house grew older it reformed. Its walls,
steeped in the purple village gossip of a century, now
echoed only to the innocent if technical prattle of
nurses. The only person who walked in its garden
was Sister: she threw crumbs to the goldfish as severely
as though the crumbs were for their good.
For the blessing which the house inherited from its
past was its garden. A small garden, like a cut
emerald, but reflecting all other jewels. It was a
garden that tried to enshrine sombre peace amid the
vivid riot of spring. Its high clipped hedges drew
decorously angular reflections in the pools. Brown
wallflowers hid the feet of the hedges. The lilacs
seemed somehow turned to half mourning by the
proximity of a copper beech. A veil of tree seeds
spinning down the wind fell diagonally across the
garden. The pink horse chestnut was very symmetrical.
Only the little saxifrages protested against
the geometrical correctness of the paving-stones, and
forget-me-nots sang a shrill song in blue from the
restraining chaperonage of red pottery tubs. A little
cupid with a dislocated hip played a noiseless flute
from a pedestal. The garden was a prig, but it
was the sort of prig that makes you wonder whether
after all it is worth while to be so exquisitely sinful.</p>

<p class='c009'>They found Samuel Rust, who was the only patient
in the hospital, the centre of a mist of nurses.
He was lying in the shade of a great smooth yew
pyramid with a military-looking bird fashioned on
the top of it. Samuel Rust, that unusual young man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>could never be much paler than he had been when
in health, but he was grey now, rather than white,
and his round sequins of eyes were set in a deeper
setting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Tra-la-la young man,” he said as the gardener
approached. “I have been wondering why
I wanted to see you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So have I,” said Mrs. Rust, who, after a momentary
lapse into a maternal expression, had turned
her back on the invalid.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s pretend I’m just an ordinary sick-bed visitor,
then,” suggested the gardener. “One never
knows why—or whether—one wants to see that
sort of visitor. In that case I have to begin:—Dear
Mr. Rust, I hope you are much better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Still posing,” said Samuel. “What is your latest
attitude?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never pose,” said the gardener. “I have a
horror of the pose. My mind’s eye sometimes
changes the spectacles it wears, but that’s all. I now
find that all along the gods were intending me to
be a business man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hard luck,” said Samuel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The nurses had melted away, and Mrs. Rust followed
them into the house. The sun was making
ready for his triumph in the west and a diffident
moon perched on the peak of the pink horse chestnut.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps one ought to have foreseen the gods’
intention of making you a business man,” said Samuel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>“for you certainly carried out the unscrupulous
deceiver part with wonderful success—That is—jolly
well—what? My Red Place now sings a
hymn of praise to you, to the tune of ten pounds a
week—clear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t mention it,” said the gardener. “It
didn’t need much unscrupulous deceiving to persuade
your mother to get her heart to work. And, to tell
you the truth, the end was rather drowned in the
means on that journey. I got so busy living—I
only thought of you when absolutely necessary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t expect you to wear my image graven on
your heart, what?” said Samuel. “You are young,
and living should certainly be your business. Is that
why you said you were a business man? I have
often thought that being young and only lately set
up in business, you had no business to saddle yourself
with a wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No business whatever,” admitted the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then why did you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good heavens,” said Samuel fretfully, “why
was I born in such a cryptic age?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The truth is—I spoke in a futurist sense when
I called her my wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In other words, you lied,” suggested Samuel.
“You just took a little tame woman on a string for
a trip, as many better men have done before you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dragged a woman by force across the Atlantic,
and then she ran away. She ran back home.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“The silly ass,” said Mr. Rust irritably. “Why
did she do that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The attitude of women towards force&nbsp;...” said
the gardener sententiously, “is not what psychologists
make it out to be. By some of the books I’ve
read, I would have thought that women worshipped
brute force; I would have thought that they kept
their hair long specially in order to be dragged about
by it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have known very few women really well,” said
Samuel; “and the ones I knew didn’t wear hair that
they could be dragged about by. I should think the
final disappearance of your post-impressionist wife
was rather a good riddance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was neither good nor a riddance. In the
same futurist sense I still call her my wife. It’s an
effort, I admit, to continue to be fond of a militant
suffragette, and yet somehow it’s an effort I can’t
help making.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Courtesy appeared, her hair an impudent rival to
the sunset.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve brought your book from the library,” she
said. “I couldn’t get any books by Somethingevsky,
as you asked, so I brought <cite>The Rosary</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ought to congratulate you on your engagement,”
said the gardener. “In fact—Mrs. Rust
being out of earshot—I do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you,” said Courtesy, looking wonderfully
pretty. “I wish everybody in the world was as
happy as I am, though of course marriage is an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>awful risk. How’s your young woman, gardener?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As militant as ever,” said the gardener. “I’m
expecting a letter from her any day, or a telegram
any minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, is she coming down here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably,” said the gardener. He had absolutely
no grounds for his confidence except the
ground of youth, and that, of course, is only a quicksand.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the funny thing was she came.</p>

<p class='c009'>For she cried all her current stock of militancy
away on Thursday night, and by three o’clock on
Good Friday afternoon she was on the door-step of
21 Penny Street.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Even if slavery and polygamy become the fashion,”
she argued characteristically, “Scottie Brown
will still be wrongfully detained in quarantine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not to Scottie Brown that her thoughts
turned when the maid told her that Mr. Gardener
had gone to the country for Easter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I must see him,” said the suffragette, who
was a little drunk with the bitter beverage of tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s impossible,” said the maid. “I tell you—he’s
away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The word “impossible” as usual acted as a challenge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Might I have his address?” said the caller.</p>

<p class='c009'>After consultation with Miss Shakespeare the address
was produced, and the suffragette’s decision
made.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>“The Red Place.... His friend lives there—Mrs.
Rust’s son. Anyway there’s no harm in going
to a country hotel for Easter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was quite an advance for the suffragette to be
human enough to consider whether there was any
harm or not.</p>

<p class='c009'>So she went home and had a ten minutes’ interview
with the mustard-coloured portmanteau, and
then she put it and herself into a third-class carriage
marked Girton Magna.</p>

<p class='c009'>At sunset she arrived at the Red Place, and by
luck extraordinary managed to procure a small attic
which the tide of holiday-makers had passed by.</p>

<p class='c009'>She saw the gardener first at dinner-time, and he
looked almost as incredible to her as she did to him.
It always surprises me to see a person looking exactly
like themselves after absence.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the gardener first saw the suffragette, he
swallowed a spoonful of soup which was very much
too hot, and rose. Courtesy was in the middle of
a remark, and looked surprised to see him go.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knew I should hear or see something of you
soon,” said the gardener, shaking the suffragette’s
hand as usual an excessive number of times. “And
yet I’m awfully surprised too,” admitted the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just an Easter holiday?” suggested the gardener
carelessly. “But what luck you chose the
Red Place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wasn’t exactly luck. I knew you were here.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Tears had been trembling in the gardener’s eyes
since the swallowing of the soup, he very nearly
shed them now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Waiter,” he called, “move that lady’s place to
our table.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette was excited and flushed. She
looked almost pretty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t imagine why I came,” she said when the
change was effected and greetings had been exchanged.
“I think I must have come in delirium.
The woman I used to be never comes into the country
except on business, and, in the case of friends,
makes a principle of ‘out of sight, out of mind.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope you left that woman behind—permanently,”
said the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. That’s the worst of it. They’re both
here. Each acts as conscience while the other one’s
in power. Why wasn’t one brought into the world
by oneself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, weren’t you?” asked Courtesy; “were you
twins?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I still am. One of me is quite a good sort,
really, almost an ‘Oh, my dear’ girl. She is the
one who was described in the paper as ‘Boadicea
Smith, a young woman of prepossessing appearance.’
The reporter went on to say that the name was probably
assumed—(which it was)—and that he knew
who I really was—(which he didn’t). He hinted
that I was a deluded patrician incog. Do you know,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>I treasure that paragraph as if it were a love-letter.
It’s the only compliment I ever had.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like to shake the hand of that reporter,”
said the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But after that he referred to me all through as
‘Smith,’ without prefix, which is the sign of a criminal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The puppy!” exclaimed the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What were you doing to get into the paper?”
asked Courtesy sternly. “I never get into the paper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s inconceivable that you should get into the
paper, Courtesy dear,” said the gardener, “except
when you get born or married or dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’d be like a sultana in a seed-cake,” said the
suffragette, “or like a sunrise at tea-time. Or as
if a Forty-nine ’bus went to the Bank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I really think she was a little delirious, and perhaps
she felt it herself, for she added apologetically,
“I always think Forty-nine is such an innocent ’bus,
it never knows the City.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning it was raining in the persistently
militant sort of way reserved by the weather for
public holidays.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A pity,” said the gardener at breakfast. “I
meant to take you over to the village to introduce
you to Mr. Rust. And there are no ’buses or taxis
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s dispense with the ’buses and taxis,” suggested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>the suffragette. “Let’s forget London and
get country-wet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll catch your death of cold,” said the gardener
delightedly, and presently they started.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t really want to be introduced to your
friend,” said the suffragette. “Only I wanted a
chance to speak to you alone. Do you know, beneath
a militant exterior I am horribly shy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s obvious,” retorted the gardener.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it?” asked the suffragette, annoyed, and relapsed
into silence for a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wanted to tell you&nbsp;...” she began again
presently, “that I beg your pardon for coming here.
It’s unforgivable of me. You know, as regards men,
I’m not a woman at all; I haven’t the unselfish instincts
that other women have. I came because
I had—reached the limit—and I wanted a
friend....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you didn’t come far wrong,” said the gardener.
“I love you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t think of your feelings at all, which is
only another proof that it is no good your loving
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I take the risk?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette stopped, and stood leaning against
the rain-whipped wind. Rain was trapped in the
mesh of her soft hair. She clenched her fists upon
her breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t you believe me&nbsp;...” she said, “when I
tell you it would be best to break up that poor little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>dream of yours—as I have broken mine. I told
you once that I had somehow been born the wrong
side of the ropes in the race. One can’t love across
a barrier.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Love is not a dream,” said the gardener. “It’s
your barrier that’s a dream. Why don’t you try
breaking that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are a man, little gardener, and I am a
thing. Not a bad thing, really, but certainly not
a woman. And even a thing can reach the point
which I have reached, the point at which there seems
nothing to do but grope and cry....”</p>

<p class='c009'>They walked a little way in silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I seem to have come to the edge of the world
by myself,” she went on. “And I can’t go on—by
myself. Oh, gardener, couldn’t we be friends
without being lovers?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That has been suggested before,” said the gardener
slowly. “And it has never succeeded. But—we—might—try....”</p>

<p class='c009'>All the rest of the way to the village I suppose
they were practising being friends and not lovers.
For neither spoke a word.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So this is the militant suffragette,” said Samuel
Rust, who was sitting in the hospital sitting-room.
“I am most interested to meet you. I have long
wished to meet a suffragette to ask her why she
wanted the vote.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why do men want it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Personally I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“Personally I do,” said the suffragette. “And
mine is as good an answer as yours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Both answers are very poor,” admitted Samuel.
“You want the vote so badly that you think it worth
while to become hysterical over it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is not much hysteria in the movement,
only hysteria is the thing that strikes a hysterical
press as most worthy of note. What hysteria there
is, is a result—not a cause. Women never invented
hysteria. How should we be anything but irresponsible,
since you have taken responsibility from us?
If we are bitter, you must remember that somebody
mixed the dose. If the womanliness you admire is
dead, bear in mind that nothing can be dead without
being killed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But who is your enemy? Who are your murderers?
I have never noticed that the majority of
men are fiends incarnate. You may not believe me,
but I do assure you that at frequent intervals in my
life I have met honest, just, and moral men. Have
you met none?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the Brown Borough I meet excellent men.
Older and wiser men, who sit on committees and
behave like one conglomerate uncle to the poor;
young lovers too hopelessly out of work to marry,
and yet always gay and good-hearted; large tired
fathers who come in after a day’s work and sit under
dripping washing and never slap the children....
But that such just men are not in a majority is proved
by the fact that women continue to suffer.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>“Yes, but perhaps they suffer at the hands—not
of men—but of circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Circumstances always favour people with a public
voice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do militant suffragettes really think that by
smashing windows they will attain to a public voice?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In what we do, we’re a poor argument for the
Franchise. In what we are, we’re the very best.
It’s not possible for the community to be hit without
deserving it. It must look round and find out
why it is hit—not how. Punishment is no good
to a smasher of windows. Any woman can see if
she’s wrong without punishment. If she thinks she’s
right, punishment can never alter her opinion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Smashers must be punished. It would be impossible
to allow even the righteous to take the law
into their own hands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In whose hands should we leave it? In the
hands of those who declare themselves to be our
enemies? A fair question from a woman never gets
a fair answer. Windows are smashed—not as an
argument, but as a protest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A protest strikes me as a futile thing. No one
ever does anything that looks unfair or tyrannical
without being perfectly sure that was the thing they
meant to do. If a protest is successful it creates discord
without altering what is done. If it’s unsuccessful,
it leaves you with a high temperature and
bruised hands, and what is gained by that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Protest isn’t a thing you argue about,” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>suffragette. “It’s a thing you do when you see red.
You seem to think that men have the monopoly of
the last straw.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is hard to believe that you have reached the
last straw,” said Samuel. “It is very hard for men
to picture women as an oppressed race. We are
miles and miles away from each other. I can still
think of a lot of things to say, but I can’t say them
without a moral megaphone. Shall we call a
draw?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s,” said the suffragette, relaxing her militant
expression. “Only let me have the last word—a
rather long one. Of one thing I am certain—when
we have the vote, men will see what a small gift it
was, and future generations will ask why it was
grudged so bitterly. Only to us who have fought
for it and suffered for it, it will always seem high and
splendid—like a flag captured in battle....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The country is looking pretty just now, isn’t it?”
said Mr. Samuel Rust.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener was standing at the window, watching
the clipped yew bird outside curtseying to the
wind. He had been pathetically silent, like a
snubbed child, ever since he had consented to be a
friend and not a lover. His white keen face was a
striking illustration of enthusiasm damped. His jaw
looked as if he were clenching his teeth on something
bitter. I think he was regretting the days when
gold hair with a ripple in it as laboured as the ripples
in an old Master’s seascape, wide blue eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>alight with matrimonial instinct, and the very red
lips of a very small mouth, were all that his heart
needed.</p>

<p class='c009'>And I wonder what the suffragette saw in his face
that made her say in a very non-militant voice,
“Come, gardener.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They both shook hands in rather an absent-minded
way with Mr. Samuel Rust. They started from the
door with the wind behind them. It was with her
hair blowing forward along her cheeks that the gardener
always remembered the suffragette most vividly.
It brought a brave idea to his mind, connected
vaguely with a picture of Grace Darling with
which he had been in love fifteen years ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gardener,” said the suffragette hurriedly.
“Can you imagine me sitting by the fire bathing a
baby?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Easily,” he replied. “I can imagine how the
firelight would dance upon your hair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That doesn’t sound like me at all,” she said,
with a catch in her voice. “Can you imagine me,
looking sleepy and cross, giving you early breakfast
before you went to work?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can imagine you with the sun behind you, saying
good-morning, so that the word seemed like a
blessing through the day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a lie—you poet,” she said. “Why don’t
you open your eyes and see me as I am?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve had my eyes open all along. It’s you who
are blind.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>“Then—suppose we become both lovers and
friends.... Suppose we get married on Tuesday....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The suffragette went up to London on Monday—Bank
Holiday—to contemplate finally the ruin
of her work. For it was dead. I suppose if she
had not felt so old and tired she might have thought
of a fresh beginning, but she was always more passionate
than persistent.</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t think the Brown Borough ever made her
suffer so much as it did the day she came back to it
and found no place for her. You must remember
she had always put work before pleasure, and a new
joy born had no place in her mind with the pain of
work killed. The gardener of yesterday retreated
from the foreground of her mind, and for a while
she never thought at all of the gardener of to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Henceforward we part company with that suffragette
whom I have loved perhaps a good deal, and of
whom you have wearied. Her heart seemed to take
on a different colour as she returned for the last time
to the Brown Borough. What she had preached for
years conquered her beyond hope at last, the world
she had fought became suddenly victor.</p>

<p class='c009'>She went to Jenny Wigsky, and found her gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>She went to see ’Tilda, who was out. But ’Tilda’s
mother spoke out ’Tilda’s mind.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>She went to see the priest’s sister, and she was
away for Easter. But the priest was at home.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had no wish ever to see you again,” said the
priest. “But it is as well that we should meet, for
I should like to make my position and that of my
sister perfectly clear to you, yerce, yerce.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is perfectly clear,” said the suffragette, who
felt curiously numb.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me, but I do not wish that you should
go away under the delusion that you are in the right
though persecuted, and in your self-absorption proceed
to make havoc of another field of work. Setting
aside the fact that you have been guilty of bad faith
towards us, you have approached the work from a
wilfully wrong standpoint. You have mixed your
despicable little political jealousies with Christian
work, to the serious danger of young and innocent
souls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I worked for the honour of women, and you—possibly—for
the honour of your God. Certainly
your work sounds better—to men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If there is a thing that women excel in, it is the
art of evading the point,” said the priest bitterly.
“The affair, bluntly put, is this: Jane Wigsky, an
idle, vicious, and immoral girl, had the impudence to
go to my very good friend, Mr. Smith, of Smith,
Bird and Co., and, presuming on her showy appearance,
to apply for a responsible post, a post which is
in every way suited to be the reward of virtue, rather
than something for the covetous to grasp at. Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Smith is, as I say, a friend of mine, and a most generous
friend to the Church, having only last week
presented a beautiful carved chancel screen.
Naturally it was my duty to tell him all I knew about
the girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what did you know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not obliged to answer to you for my statements,
but, as a matter of fact, I told him that the
girl was not a ‘stayer’—in colloquial language—and
that she was of immoral tendency.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was only what you fancied. What did you
know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a swallowing sound in the priest’s
throat, a sound as of one keeping his temper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I ask if you are aware that the girl has
now disappeared, with her lover?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But that was since you wrote.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not worked for twenty-two years among
the poor without reaching a certain insight into character;
I am not blind to such things, whatever you
may be, yerce, yerce. But that is beside the point.
I reminded Smith that he might be able to give her
less important employment—I was willing to help
the girl up to a certain point. I suggested a protégé
of my own for the better post, to whom the generous
opportunity offered would be far more suitable, a
very deserving young man, who is debarred from
ordinary employment by the loss of a leg. Mr.
Smith accepted my suggestion, and offered Jane Wigsky
a post as packer, at seven-and-six a week, a much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>larger wage than she has been getting lately. She
refused, and put the responsibility of her refusal on
you. She also mentioned that other girls in the
Church Club were under your influence on the question
of wages. I made enquiries and found that my
sister’s club was in a fair way to turn into a female
Trade Union, an abominable anomaly. I took the
only course possible. I dismissed all the misguided
girls from the Club. There is nothing more to be
said.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing,” said the suffragette, who had become
very white, “except—what must your God be like
to have a servant like you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you are going to blaspheme,” said the priest,
“kindly leave my house at once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If God is like that&nbsp;...” she said, “I pray the
Devil may win.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She ran out of the house childishly, and slammed
the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gardener, on Tuesday morning, was parting his
hair for the third time, when he received a telegram:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t come.—Suffragette.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It startled him, but not very much. He looked at
the third attempt at a parting in the glass, and saw
that it was an excellent parting for a man on his wedding-day.
He reflected that a militant suffragette
would naturally tend to become ultra-militant on this
final day. And if the worst came to the worst, it
could do no harm to go up and find out how bad the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>worst was. So he went up to London by the eleven
train.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was to meet her at the little bun-shop that
clings for protection to the Brown Borough Town
Hall. There the suffragette had a fourpenny meal
daily, and there they had arranged to have an eightpenny
meal together, before assuming the married
pose. There was a “wedding-shop” round the
corner. I don’t suppose any couple ever made less
impressive plans.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the gardener pursued the plan. He entirely
ignored the telegram.</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t know whether the suffragette was confident
that he would obey it, or that he would ignore
it. I am entirely doubtful about her state of mind
on that day. But I know that when the gardener
arrived at the bun-shop she was there, facing the
door, already half-way through her fourpenny lunch.
Which appears to show that—if her telegram was
genuine—she put implicit faith in his obedience.
In this case she was presumably displeased to see him.
Her face, however, looked too tired to change its
expression in any way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t you get my wire?” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is a wire to me?” asked the gardener,
sitting down.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a long pause, during which he ordered
a Welsh Rarebit from a waitress who, six months
ago, would have furnished him with an ideal of
womanhood.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“Why did you wire?” he asked presently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have to go on a journey,” said the suffragette,
waving at the mustard-coloured portmanteau, which
was seated on a chair beside her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In that case, so have I,” said the gardener.
“We’ll get married first, and then go on the journey
together.”</p>

<p class='c009'>No reply. Their talk was like broken fragments
thrown upon a sea of ice. It hurried, faltered,
stopped, and then froze into a background of silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener noticed that the suffragette was
trembling violently, and with a great effort he made
no comment on this discovery.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally she rose, leaving quite twopence-halfpenny
worth of her meal hiding beneath her knife and fork.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll have to show me where this registry office
is,” said the gardener, “and also what to do. I
don’t know how one gets married.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither do I,” said the suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll carry your bag.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I like carrying things. I hate being helped.
You must always remember that I am a militant suffragette.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am never allowed to forget it,” sighed the gardener,
his ardour rather damped. “Are we getting
near the place?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very near.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They stopped at the steps of a church.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We might have thought it our duty to be married
in a church,” she said. “What a merciful escape!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>He was silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hate God,” she added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t,” said the gardener. “You’re too excited.
Don’t tremble like that. Don’t hate God.
After all, He made the world—a green sane world—with
you and me in it....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He made it with you in it. But I got in by mistake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a happy mistake!” said the gardener.
“Come into the church, my dear, and rest for a moment.
Don’t try to look too deep into the reasons
of things, you’ll only get giddy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He took her hand, and they went up the steps together.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a fine church,” he said. “That screen’s a
fine bit of carving.” He felt as if he had taken
charge of his suffragette’s nerves, and he busied his
brain in the composition of cool and commonplace
remarks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That chancel screen is dirty. It’s the gift of
foul hands, bought with foul money. Do you think
me mad?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are, rather, you know. Pull yourself
together. Surely you’re not frightened of getting
married to me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suffragette laughed. “You wonderfully
faithful friend,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gardener was not a religious young man. He
was not quite rare enough in texture for that, and he
was a little too clever for the religion of his fathers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>The Christian pose had never appealed to him, it was
not unique enough. All his life he had seen prayer
used as a method of commercial telegraphy. You
wanted a thing, and from a kneeling position you informed
Heaven of your order. If it was complied
with, you knew that you must be appreciated in high
quarters; if it was ignored, you supposed that your
message had miscarried, and despatched another.
At any rate it cost nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the gardener had a vague reverence inborn in
him. During his everyday life he posed as an unbeliever.
When in his own unposing company he
passively believed in something he had never defined.
But under stained-glass windows or the benediction
of music, under arched forests and a sinless sky, under
the passionate sane spell of the sea, under the
charm of love, he knew that he worshipped. For
he was a poet without the means of proving it, and to
such God is a secret mouthpiece, and a salvation.</p>

<p class='c009'>So, at the back of the church, beside the suffragette,
he pressed his face into his hands, and his elbows
on to his knees, and found to his surprise that his
heart was beating violently. Between his fingers he
could see the east window. Its blood-like splashes
of red, its banners of unearthly blue, its blur of
golden haloes glorified the sunlight. It seemed to
have a colour for each of his days; he found his
childhood in it, and his little ambitions, his pale Tra-la-la
days, and the babyhood of his heart, red hair
he found, and the ardour of the sea, and love....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>And presently he looked round and found his companion
had gone from his side.</p>

<p class='c009'>He could see her, with her chin up, looking defiantly
at the altar. The sunlight dramatically
touched her distant face, and it was like a pin-prick in
the twilight of the church. It was but seldom that
nature provided a good setting for my suffragette.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was only when he saw her with the mustard-coloured
portmanteau raised shoulder high that he
realised what she was doing. The knowledge tore a
gash across his dreams, and severed him from himself.
He did not move. He watched her throw the
portmanteau at the foot of the chancel screen. He
saw her wrap her arms about her face and swing
round on her heel. He hardly heard the explosion,
but directly afterwards he realised how loud it had
been.</p>

<p class='c009'>Smoke danced across the altar, smoke blotted out
the window, smoke threaded the lace of the shattered
screen. Smoke.... Silver in the sunlight&nbsp;...
blue round the altar&nbsp;... and grey—dead grey—over
the little crumpled body of the criminal. Smoke
stood over her, a transitory monument—like a tree—like
a curse.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, I pose of course. But the question is—how
deep may a pose extend?</p>

<p class='c009'><cite>The Research Magnificent</cite> is pronounced by those critics who
have read it to be the best work that Mr. Wells has done, realizing
fully the promises of greatness which not a few have found in its
immediate predecessors. The author’s theme—the research magnificent—is
the story of one man’s search for the kingly life. A
subject such as this is one peculiarly suited to Mr. Wells’s literary
genius, and he has handled it with the skill, the feeling, the vision,
which it requires.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It has been over a month since <cite>The Research Magnificent</cite> came
from the press. In that month the book has been reviewed from
one end of the country to the other, but I have not written anything
about it for the good reason that I have been all of this time
reading it, a little at a time, with much thought spent between the
sentences, with all sorts of comments and memories and injunctions
crying to be written in the margins and with the towering immensity
of the thing awing me into either an incoherence of superlatives
or silence. I have waited for the clarity of impression that
comes with the closing of the covers of a book that has marked an
epoch in my literary life.... <cite>The Research Magnificent</cite> is a book
whose intensity of influence will be immeasurable in the lives of
those who read it. It is enthralling in its sheer literary magnificence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Daring in its theme and vivid in execution, this is one of the most
original and gripping stories Mr. London has ever written. The
fundamental idea upon which the plot rests—the supremacy of
mind over body—has served to inspire writers before, but rarely,
if indeed ever, has it been employed as strikingly or with as much
success as in this book. With a wealth of coloring and detail the
author tells of what came of an attempt on the part of the hero to
free his spirit from his body, of the wonderful adventures this
“star rover” had, adventures covering long lapses of years and
introducing strange people in stranger lands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Delabole is a Cornish slate mining town and the tale which
Mr. Phillpotts tells against it as a background, one in which a
matter of honor or conscience is the pivot, is dramatic in situation
and doubly interesting because of the moral problem which it
presents. Mr. Phillpotts’s artistry and keen perception of those
motives which actuate conduct have never been better exhibited.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<cite>Old Delabole</cite>,” says Elia W. Peattie in the <cite>Chicago Tribune</cite>,
“is unusual. Its characters stand up boldly like monoliths against
a gray sky. The struggle of life and the philosophy of life, old
age as well as youth, dullness as well as quiet wisdom, play their
part in the tale.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The joyousness of life lived in an imaginative world is Mr.
Blackwood’s theme, a theme not unlike Maeterlinck’s <cite>The Bluebird</cite>.
His new story is fine in literary quality and in imaginative
conception.</p>

<p class='c009'>A group of delightful children learn to gain for themselves an
“extra day” which, as a matter of time, does not count, and this
day is filled with wonderful adventures. As in some of his other
writings Mr. Blackwood plays about the idea that little children
are so close to the line that divides the mysteries of the spiritual
world from the actualities that in fancy they pass back and forth
across this line.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is much of timely significance in Miss Gale’s new book.
For example, one of the most interesting and powerful of its scenes
takes place at a meeting of the Women’s Peace Congress and in
the course of the action there are introduced bits of the actual
speeches delivered at the most recent session of this congress. But
<cite>Heart’s Kindred</cite> is not merely a plea for peace; it is rather the
story of the making of a man—and of the rounding out of a
woman’s character, too. In the rough, unpolished, but thoroughly
sincere Westerner and the attractive young woman who brings
out the good in the man’s nature, Miss Gale has two as absorbing
people as she has ever created. In <cite>Heart’s Kindred</cite> is reflected
that humanness and breadth of vision which was first found in
<cite>Friendship Village</cite> and <cite>The Loves of Pelleas</cite> and <cite>Etarre</cite> and made
